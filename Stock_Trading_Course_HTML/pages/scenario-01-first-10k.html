<h2>Week 1: Your First Decisions (April 1-5, 2024)</h2>
<h3>Market Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stock market stable</li>
<li>No major news</li>
<li>Good time to start</li>
<li>S&P 500 at 5,200</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Decision Framework</h3>
<p><strong>Diversification Decision</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>
Option A: Buy 1 stock and concentrate

- Pros: Simpler

- Cons: All risk in one stock



Option B: Buy 3-5 stocks

- Pros: Reduced risk

- Cons: More work



Option C: Buy an index fund (SPY) + some individual stocks

- Pros: Diversification + learning

- Cons: More research



YOUR CHOICE: ___________________

</code></pre>
<h3>Recommended Starting Allocation</h3>
<p>For a beginner with $10,000:</p>
<pre><code>
$5,000 - SPY (Broad S&amp;P 500 index) - CORE

$2,000 - Tech stock (MSFT, AAPL, or NVDA) - GROWTH

$1,500 - Dividend stock (JNJ, PG, KO) - INCOME

$1,000 - Cash reserve - SAFETY

$500 - Available for &quot;opportunities&quot;

</code></pre>
<h3>Your First Decisions</h3>
<p><strong>Decision 1A: Start with SPY</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Time: April 1, 9:35 AM

Price of SPY: $529.70

Quantity to buy: $5,000 / $529.70 = 9.44 shares (round to 9 shares)

Cost: 9 × $529.70 = $4,767.30

Cash remaining: $10,000 - $4,767.30 = $5,232.70

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Do you think starting with index fund is right? (Yes/No)</p>
<p><strong>Decision 1B: Pick a Tech Stock</strong></p>
<p>You review 3 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSFT: $425, large cap, safe, growing</li>
<li>NVDA: $875, AI play, high growth, more volatile</li>
<li>AAPL: $190, huge company, stable, pays dividend</li>
</ul>
<p>Your research:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSFT: Solid company, reasonable valuation, good balance</li>
<li>NVDA: Everyone's buying this (AI boom), but at what price?</li>
<li>AAPL: Boring but reliable, good track record</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which do you pick and why?</strong> <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong>: MSFT (balanced choice)</p>
<pre><code>
Time: April 1, 10:15 AM

Price of MSFT: $425.20

Quantity to buy: $2,000 / $425.20 = 4.70 shares (round to 4 shares)

Cost: 4 × $425.20 = $1,700.80

Cash remaining: $5,232.70 - $1,700.80 = $3,531.90

Stop loss: $404 (5% below entry) - WRITE THIS DOWN

Profit target: $552 (30% above entry) - WRITE THIS DOWN

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Decision 1C: Pick a Dividend Stock</strong></p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>JNJ: $158, pharma, 2.8% yield, very stable</li>
<li>KO: $62, beverages, 3.1% yield, very stable</li>
<li>PG: $168, consumer goods, 2.9% yield, very stable</li>
</ul>
<p>All are good. Pick the one you like:</p>
<p><strong>Which do you pick?</strong> <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong>: KO (lower price, easier to understand)</p>
<pre><code>
Time: April 1, 11:00 AM

Price of KO: $62.35

Quantity to buy: $1,500 / $62.35 = 24.04 shares (round to 24 shares)

Cost: 24 × $62.35 = $1,496.40

Cash remaining: $3,531.90 - $1,496.40 = $2,035.50

Stop loss: $59.2 (5% below entry)

Profit target: $81 (30% above entry)

<li>Cash drag: -$0 (stayed flat)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lessons from Your First Portfolio</h2>
<h3>Lesson 1: Discipline Beats Emotion</h3>
<ul>
<li>You had a plan at the start (buy SPY, MSFT, KO)</li>
<li>You stuck to it even when markets dipped</li>
<li>Result: Small but consistent gain</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had panic-sold on June 3, you'd be down 3.8%. Instead you're up 6.86%.</p>
<h3>Lesson 2: Diversification Protects You</h3>
<p>Your 4 positions allowed you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get broad market (SPY)</li>
<li>Pick winners (MSFT)</li>
<li>Get income (KO)</li>
<li>Add diversity (Healthcare)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd put all $10,000 in MSFT, your return would be +8.2% (better!). But if MSFT had crashed, you'd lose more too.</p>
<p>Diversification = safety + consistent returns.</p>
<h3>Lesson 3: Cash is a Position</h3>
<p>Your $1,000 cash reserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let you sleep at night</li>
<li>Prevented forced selling</li>
<li>Would have let you buy a crash (if one happened)</li>
<li>Is boring but valuable</li>
</ul>
<p>Many new investors get this wrong. Cash feels "wasteful" but it's actually strategic.</p>
<h3>Lesson 4: Your Rules Worked</h3>
<p>You wrote down 8 rules at the start. Did they help?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule 1 (20% max per position): Kept you from overleveraging</li>
<li>Rule 2 (Stop loss): Gave you an exit plan (never triggered)</li>
<li>Rule 3 (5 positions max): Kept it simple</li>
<li>Rule 4 (Sell 50% at +30%): Didn't trigger, but would have locked profits</li>
<li>Rule 5 (Sell at -15%): Provided safety net (never triggered)</li>
<li>Rule 6 (Weekly not daily): Kept you from overtrading</li>
<li>Rule 7 (No margin): Kept you safe</li>
<li>Rule 8 (10% cash): Gave you flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Having rules and following them beats trying to time the market.</p>
<h3>Lesson 5: Time and Patience</h3>
<p>12 weeks is 3 months. Your 6.86% return is annualized to:</p>
<ul>
<li>6.86% × 4 = ~27% annualized</li>
</ul>
<p>That's excellent. But you made it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being patient</li>
<li>Not trading much (only initial entry)</li>
<li>Holding through volatility</li>
<li>Following your plan</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how wealth is built. Not exciting, but reliable.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
<h3>If You Did Well (Gained 5%+)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Congratulations, you learned the fundamentals</li>
<li>Consider running scenario 06 (single stock trade)</li>
<li>Then move to scenario 02 (volatility management)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If You Lost Money (Down 5%+)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry, learning from losses is valuable</li>
<li>Review your decisions</li>
<li>Understand what went wrong:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Did you panic sell?</p>
<p>  - Did you overtrade?</p>
<p>  - Did you ignore your rules?</p>
<ul>
<li>Try scenario 01 again with a different approach</li>
</ul>
<h3>If You Broke Even</h3>
<ul>
<li>You learned about volatility (that's valuable)</li>
<li>Try again but with slightly more aggressive positions</li>
<li>Or try scenario 01 again during a different market period</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Did you stick to your rules?</strong> Which rule was hardest?</li>
<li><strong>When did you feel most stressed?</strong> (Probably June 3-4 dip)</li>
<li><strong>When did you feel most excited?</strong> (Probably week 5 when up 2.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Did you check your portfolio too often?</strong> (Can be unhealthy)</li>
