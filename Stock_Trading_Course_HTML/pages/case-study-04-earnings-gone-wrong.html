                <h1>Case Study 04: Earnings Play That Failed - Why Expected Moves Don't Happen</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>A seemingly perfect earnings play setup fails catastrophically when implied volatility collapses and the stock gaps down 22% despite beating earnings. This case study examines why earnings trades are dangerous, why volatility expectations fail, and how proper stop losses would have contained the damage.</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: January 20 - February 2, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Entry Price</strong>: $78.50</p>
<p><strong>Exit Price</strong>: $61.20</p>
<p><strong>Loss</strong>: -22.0% in 10 trading days</p>
<p><strong>Mistake</strong>: No stop loss, holding through earnings</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: IV crush and expected moves are not guaranteed</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Setup: A Seemingly Perfect Earnings Play</h2>
<h3>Stock: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)</h3>
<p><strong>Company Profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity software company</li>
<li>Rapid growth: 30%+ annual growth rate</li>
<li>Stock up 80% year-to-date</li>
<li>Earnings report: February 1, 2024 after market close</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why It Looked Like a Perfect Setup:</strong></p>
<p>Trader Profile: Angela Rodriguez</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience: 2 years (still relatively new)</li>
<li>Account: $50,000</li>
<li>Style: Options and short-term trades</li>
<li>Mistake: Overconfidence in thesis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Research Angela Did:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Analyst Expectations:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - EPS guidance: $0.67 (consensus)</p>
<p>   - Revenue guidance: $730M (consensus)</p>
<p>   - Company has beat last 8 quarters in a row</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technical Setup:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Stock near all-time high at $78.50</p>
<p>   - RSI at 68 (strong but not overbought)</p>
<p>   - Support at $75</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Options Volatility Analysis:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - IV Rank: 78% (implied volatility high compared to historical)</p>
<p>   - Expected move: ±$7.85 (10% move expected)</p>
<p>   - Straddle cost: $8.50 (expecting move bigger than this)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conviction Level:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - "This company crushes earnings every time"</p>
<p>   - "Beat last 8 quarters"</p>
<p>   - "Stock has more room to run"</p>
<p>   - "IV is high, but company delivers"</p>
<h3>Angela's Trade Setup</h3>
<p><strong>The Thesis:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"CRWD has beaten 8 quarters in a row. Stock is near highs but momentum is strong. IV is elevated at 78%, pricing in ~10% move. If they beat again (very likely), stock will gap up 15%+. The 10% implied move is too conservative."</blockquote>
<p><strong>Angela's Trade:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Date: January 30, 2024 (2 days before earnings)

Entry: Buy 640 shares at $78.50

Cost: $50,240 (using 100% of available capital)

Plan: Hold through earnings, expect 15% upside gap

Target: $90+ (13% gain)

Stop Loss: &quot;I&#39;ll set one if it drops below $75&quot;

Risk: &quot;The company beats every quarter&quot;

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Options Context (She also bought calls):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Options Position (separate from stock):

- Bought 5 Call contracts (500 shares)

- Strike: $80

- Expiration: Feb 2 (4 days after earnings, next week)

- Premium paid: $3.50 × 500 = $1,750

- Breakeven: $83.50

- Max profit: Unlimited



Total capital at risk: $50,240 + $1,750 = $51,990 (more than account)

Leverage: Using margin for the calls, overleveraged

<h2>The Earnings Event: February 1, 2024</h2>
<h3>The Numbers: A Solid Beat</h3>
<p><strong>After Market Close (4:05 PM):</strong></p>
<p>Earnings announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPS: $0.72 (vs. expected $0.67) → +7.5% beat</li>
<li>Revenue: $747M (vs. expected $730M) → +2.3% beat</li>
<li>Forward guidance: Raised revenue guidance 8%</li>
<li>Customer metrics: Excellent (churn down, NRR up)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Angela's Reaction (4:15 PM):</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Perfect! They beat on both numbers. Guidance is raised. This is exactly what I expected. Stock should gap up 15-20% tomorrow morning. I might sell half at the open to lock in profits."</blockquote>
<h3>After-Hours Trading: The Problem</h3>
<p><strong>After-hours session (4:30 PM - 8:00 PM):</strong></p>
<p>Instead of gapping up, something unexpected happens:</p>
<pre><code>
Time        Price       Volume      Event

4:15 PM     $78.50      Normal      Just after earnings

4:35 PM     $76.80      2M shares   Starting to sell

5:00 PM     $75.20      3M shares   More sellers emerge

5:30 PM     $72.80      4M shares   Heavy selling pressure

6:00 PM     $70.50      5M shares   Cascade selling

6:30 PM     $68.20      6M shares   Fear setting in

7:00 PM     $66.00      7M shares   Capitulation selling

8:00 PM     $64.90      9M shares   Session close

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Angela's After-Hours Horror:</strong></p>
<p>She's watching in real-time:</p>
<blockquote>"Why is it selling off? They beat earnings! The guidance is up! This doesn't make sense. It's down 15% after-hours. Should I sell? But maybe this is just after-hours weakness and it bounces at the open?</blockquote>
<blockquote>I'm down $8,960 already (on stock) + $1,750 (calls are worthless now). I'm -$10,710 in 90 minutes."</blockquote>
<h3>The Gap-Down Open: February 2</h3>
<p><strong>February 2, 2024 - Market Open:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Pre-market:    $64.90 (from after-hours)

Official open: $61.20 (16-minute halt, then opens lower)

Gap from prev close: -22% ($78.50 → $61.20)

Volume at open: 50M shares

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Angela checks her account:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock position: 640 × $61.20 = $39,168

Cost: $50,240

Loss: -$11,072 (-22%)



Call options: Now worthless (stock below strike $80)

Loss: -$1,750



Total loss: -$12,822 in overnight (first half of trading day)

Percentage: -25% of her $50,000 account

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Angela's Thoughts (9:45 AM, market open):</strong></p>
<blockquote>"This is a nightmare. The stock beat earnings. The guidance is up. Why is it down 22%? I can't hold this. I need to sell."</blockquote>
<p>She panic-sells at the open:</p>
<pre><code>
Sells: 640 shares

Price: $61.20

Revenue: $39,168

Realized loss: -$11,072 (-22%)

<h2>What Went Wrong: The Root Cause Analysis</h2>
<h3>Factor 1: Implied Volatility Crush</h3>
<p><strong>The Options Volatility Collapse:</strong></p>
<p>Before earnings:</p>
<pre><code>
IV Rank (CRWD)     78% (very high, pricing in big move)

Expected move      ±10% based on straddle pricing

Straddle cost      $8.50

This suggested    13-15% move likely

</code></pre>
<p>After earnings announcement:</p>
<pre><code>
IV Rank drops to    12% (collapsed)

IV decreased by     85%

Straddle value      $2.10 (down 75%)

Expected move now   ±2.5%

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Math:</strong></p>
<p>When a stock beats earnings but IV collapses, the realized move can be smaller than the implied move.</p>
<p>Angela bought at 78% IV rank, expecting a 15%+ move. The market implied 10% (±$7.85). When that didn't happen, the IV crush destroyed the premium she'd paid.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of what "beating earnings" should mean, but here's why it happened:</p>
<h3>Factor 2: The IV Crush Effect (The Real Villain)</h3>
<p><strong>What is IV Crush?</strong></p>
<p>Implied Volatility measures expected future volatility. Before earnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRWD IV: 78% annual volatility (very high)</li>
<li>This prices in ~10% move</li>
</ul>
<p>After earnings announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>IV drops to 12% annual volatility</li>
<li>This happens regardless of earnings result</li>
<li>It happens because the UNCERTAIN event (earnings) is now CERTAIN (announced)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock price move: +2% (from $78.50 to $80 would be a 2% gain)

Implied move: ±10%

Option value at earnings release = combination of:

  - Stock move: +2% is minimal

  - IV crush: Reduces remaining time value

  - Result: Options lose 75% value despite beating earnings

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Angela's Call Options Math:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Before earnings:

- Stock at $78.50

- Call strike $80 is slightly OTM

- IV at 78%

- 5 days to expiration

- Call value: $3.50 per share ($1,750 total)



After earnings announcement:

- Stock at $61.20 (down from $78.50)

- Call strike $80 is now deeply OTM

- IV at 12%

- 4 days to expiration

- Call value: $0.05 per share ($25 total)

- Loss: $1,725 (98% loss)



Even though earnings beat, the options collapsed.

</code></pre>
<h3>Factor 3: Market Context Angela Missed</h3>
<p><strong>What was happening in the broader market:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
February 1-2, 2024 (The dates matter):

- Fed held rates steady at 5.5%

- CPI data surprised to the high side

- Market pivoted to &quot;rates staying high longer&quot;

- Risk-off sentiment moved through all growth stocks

- Nasdaq down 2% that day

</code></pre>
<p>Angela thought:</p>
<blockquote>"CRWD beats earnings, goes up 15%"</blockquote>
<p>Market reality:</p>
<blockquote>"Growth stocks are selling off broadly due to rate concerns, CRWD's good earnings can't overcome sector selloff"</blockquote>
<p>When earnings beat but market is risk-off, IV crush can dominate the move.</p>
<h3>Factor 4: The 8-Quarter Streak Bias</h3>
<p><strong>Angela's Overconfidence:</strong></p>
<p>She noted: "Beat last 8 quarters in a row, very likely to beat again"</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beating is partially random (luck)</li>
<li>But when you beat 8x, market prices in continued beats</li>
<li>Raised expectations are built into the stock</li>
<li>Missing even slightly causes disappointment</li>
<li>A "beat" on moderate metrics isn't enough</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Actual Beat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EPS: +7.5% beat (modest)</li>
<li>Revenue: +2.3% beat (small)</li>
<li>Guidance raised: +8% (good but not stellar)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Market's Interpretation:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Earnings beat but not as big as we expected. Guidance raise is modest. In a rising-rate environment, this is not enough to justify 10%+ gains. Selling."</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The IV Crush Trap</h2>
<h3>Understanding IV Rank vs. IV Percentile</h3>
<p><strong>For Angela to understand the trap:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
IV Rank 78% means:

- Volatility is in the 78th percentile of its range

- BUT it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;78% is high&quot;

- It means &quot;78% between the lowest and highest volatility&quot;

- This is different from IV Percentile

</code></pre>
<p><strong>IV Percentile (Better Metric):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Would show: What % of trading days have IV lower than today?

IV Rank 78% usually means: IV Percentile is 78%

Result: There&#39;s a 22% chance IV will be higher



For earnings trades:

- If IV Percentile is 78%, expected move is large

- After earnings, IV crushes regardless of outcome

- This is GUARANTEED

- You&#39;re betting on which way it moves AND hoping IV doesn&#39;t crush

</code></pre>
<h3>The Lesson: Earnings Trades Are Binary</h3>
<p><strong>The Possible Outcomes:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Outcome 1: Beat + Market In Risk-On Mode

- IV doesn&#39;t crush (stays elevated)

- Stock moves significantly higher (15-20%)

- Winner: Angela wins big



Outcome 2: Beat + Market In Risk-Off Mode (What happened)

- IV crushes (30-50% IV drop typical)

- Stock moves slightly up/down (±5%)

- Winner: Neither, but shorts the call premium

- Loser: Angela loses on premium crush



Outcome 3: Miss + Market Doesn&#39;t Care

- IV crushes

- Stock moves down 5-10%

- Loser: Angela loses on stock move AND IV crush

- Loss magnitude: -15 to -25%



Outcome 4: Miss + Market Cares

- IV crushes less (stays elevated)

- Stock moves down 15-20%

- Loser: Angela loses big

- Loss magnitude: -25% to -35%

</code></pre>
<p>Angela could only win in Outcome 1. She faced:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% chance of Outcome 2 (what happened)</li>
<li>25% chance of Outcome 3</li>
<li>50% chance of Outcome 4 (even worse)</li>
</ul>
<p>Her 75% chance of loss was much higher than she calculated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Angela Should Have Done: The Risk Management Approach</h2>
<h3>Option 1: Use a Stop Loss</h3>
<p><strong>If Angela had entered with a stop loss:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Entry: $78.50

Stop Loss: $75.00 (3.5% below entry)

Risk: $3.50 × 640 = $2,240

Downside scenario: Loses $2,240 maximum



Actual outcome: Down 22%

With stop loss: Down 3.5%

Difference: Would have saved $8,832

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why she didn't use a stop loss:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"This company never misses. I'm not scared. Why would I need a stop loss?"</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the overconfidence that destroys accounts. The companies that "never miss" are the ones most dangerous when they finally do or when the market turns against them.</p>
<h3>Option 2: Smaller Position Size</h3>
<p><strong>If Angela had sized the position smaller:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Instead of: 640 shares ($50,240) = 100% of account

Could have done: 320 shares ($25,120) = 50% of account

Or even: 160 shares ($12,560) = 25% of account



If 50% position size:

- Loss would be -$5,536 instead of -$11,072

- Still significant but survivable

- Account at $44,464 instead of $38,968

- Can recover with 10% gain on remaining capital

</code></pre>
<h3>Option 3: Reduce Earnings Eve Exposure</h3>
<p><strong>If Angela had sold before earnings:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
January 30: Buys 640 shares at $78.50

January 31: Stock at $78.90 (up slightly)

Decision: Sell 50% before earnings announcement

- Sells 320 shares at $78.90

- Revenue: $25,248

- Profit: $256



February 1: Keeps 320 shares through earnings

- Stock gaps down to $61.20

- Loss on 320 shares: -$5,536

- Overall result: -$5,280 loss (vs -$11,072)

</code></pre>
<p>This is typical earnings strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take initial position pre-announcement</li>
<li>Reduce position to "house money" amount</li>
<li>Hold small portion through binary event</li>
<li>Reduces risk significantly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 4: Use a Defined-Risk Structure (Spreads)</h3>
<p><strong>If Angela had bought a call spread:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Instead of: Buy 5 calls at $80 strike

Could do: Call spread

- Buy 5 calls at $80 strike

- Sell 5 calls at $85 strike

- Net cost: $1.50 (instead of $3.50)

- Max profit: $2.50 × 500 = $1,250

- Max loss: Cost = $750



Benefits:

- Defined risk ($750 max)

- Lower cost (defined premium)

- IV crush less damaging (short call offsets long call)

</code></pre>

<h2>The Real Issue: Angela Had No Rules</h2>
<h3>Angela's Rule Violation List</h3>
<p><strong>Rules she should have had but didn't:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Position Size Rule</strong>: ❌ Violates "Position size should not exceed 3% of account per trade"</li>
</ol>
<p>   - She used 100% on single earnings trade</p>
<p>   - Should have been max 30% ($15,000)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop Loss Rule</strong>: ❌ Violates "Every trade needs a stop loss defined before entry"</li>
</ol>
<p>   - She had no stop loss</p>
<p>   - Refused to accept downside risk</p>
<p>   - Was stopped out by forced selling, not her rule</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leverage Rule</strong>: ❌ Violates "Total margin should not exceed 20% of account"</li>
</ol>
<p>   - She used margin for options</p>
<p>   - Combined stock + options exceeded account capital</p>
<p>   - Over-leveraged going into binary event</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Earnings Rule</strong>: ❌ Violates "Hold no more than 25% of account through earnings announcement"</li>
</ol>
<p>   - She held 100% through earnings</p>
<p>   - Exposed to IV crush and binary move</p>
<p>   - No hedging or reduced size</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>IV Rule</strong>: ❌ Violates "Don't buy options when IV is 70%+ of range"</li>
</ol>
<p>   - She bought calls when IV was 78%</p>
<p>   - IV crush was guaranteed to happen</p>
<p>   - Paid maximum premium for uncertain outcome</p>
<h3>What Angela's Rules Should Have Been</h3>
<pre><code>
RULES FOR EARNINGS TRADES:



1. Max position size: 20% of account

2. Min stop loss: 3% below entry OR technical support

3. Max leverage: 0% (no margin on earnings trades)

4. Risk/Reward ratio: Minimum 1:2

5. If buying options: Only if IV &lt; 50th percentile

6. If buying calls: Only if defined profit target within options profit zone

7. Reduce position size 50% if earnings in &lt; 5 days

8. Never use margin to buy calls

9. If call is profitable day-of-earnings: TAKE PROFIT

10. Never hold earnings into close with 100% of position



Angela violated every single one.

<h2>The Probability Analysis Angela Missed</h2>
<h3>Expected Value of Angela's Trade</h3>
<p><strong>What Angela should have calculated:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Outcome 1: Beat, market stays risk-on (20% chance)

- Stock gaps up 15%

- Angela gains: +$7,560

- Position: 640 × $90.25 = $57,760



Outcome 2: Beat, market turns risk-off (25% chance) [What happened]

- Stock gaps down 22%

- Angela loses: -$11,072

- Position: 640 × $61.20 = $39,168



Outcome 3: Meet, market risk-off (30% chance)

- Stock flat to down 5%

- Angela loses: -$1,500 to -$3,000

- Position: Down 2-4%



Outcome 4: Miss, market risk-off (25% chance)

- Stock down 20%

- Angela loses: -$10,048

- Position: Stock at $62.80



Expected value = 0.20(+$7,560) + 0.25(-$11,072) + 0.30(-$2,250) + 0.25(-$10,048)

              = +$1,512 - $2,768 - $675 - $2,512

              = -$4,443



Expected loss per attempt: -$4,443

For 1 trade: Breakeven at 50% win rate

For 10 trades: Expected total loss: -$44,430

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Angela's Assumption:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"8-for-8 on beating earnings, so 100% win rate"</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expected value is NEGATIVE even with 100% earnings beats</li>
<li>Because IV crush plus market context matters more</li>
<li>Risk/reward was not in her favor</li>
<li>She needed 80%+ win rate to break even</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Key Lessons</h2>
<h3>Lesson 1: IV Crush Happens Regardless of Earnings Direction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before earnings: High IV prices in large move</li>
<li>After earnings: IV collapses</li>
<li>This happens to EVERY earnings stock</li>
<li>Even if stock moves 15%, options lose 40-50% on IV crush</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 2: Earnings Trades Require Defined Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Either small position size (2-5% of account)</li>
<li>Or stop loss (3-5% below entry)</li>
<li>Or both</li>
<li>Not "I'm confident so no stop loss"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 3: Broad Market Context Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>CRWD beat earnings</li>
<li>But Nasdaq was down 2% that day</li>
<li>Risk-off sentiment dominated</li>
<li>Individual stock fundamentals can't overcome sector/market headwind</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 4: 8 Wins in a Row Doesn't Mean 9th Is Likely</h3>
<ul>
<li>Past performance is not predictive (except statistically)</li>
<li>Winning streaks increase overconfidence</li>
<li>But they also increase probability of regression</li>
<li>When it breaks, it often breaks with maximum surprise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 5: No Rule Beaten by Greed/Overconfidence</h3>
<p>Angela didn't have rules because:</p>
<ul>
<li>She was overconfident in her analysis</li>
<li>She had seen it work before (hindsight bias)</li>
<li>She refused to accept downside risk</li>
<li>She thought she knew better than risk management</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the single biggest account-killer.</p>
