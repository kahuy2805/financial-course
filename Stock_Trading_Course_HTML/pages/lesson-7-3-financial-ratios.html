<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Financial ratios are the shortcuts professional analysts use to quickly assess a company's valuation, profitability, and financial health. Master these four critical ratios and you'll be able to evaluate any stock in minutes instead of hours.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 25-30 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completion of Lesson 7.2: Reading Financial Statements</li>
<li>Understanding of earnings per share (EPS)</li>
<li>Basic division and percentage calculations</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>What are Financial Ratios?</h3>
<p><strong>Financial Ratios</strong> are calculations that compare different financial metrics to reveal insights about valuation, profitability, and financial health.</p>
<p><strong>Key Principle:</strong> A ratio by itself is meaningless. Compare it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical average (is it higher or lower than usual?)</li>
<li>Industry average (how does it compare to competitors?)</li>
<li>Market average (is it expensive or cheap vs. market?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ratio 1: P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> How many dollars investors pay for $1 of annual profit.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
P/E = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share



Example:

Stock Price: $100

EPS: $5

P/E = 100 ÷ 5 = 20



Interpretation: Paying $20 for every $1 of profit

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Apple: Stock $180, EPS $6, P/E = 30

- Investors pay $30 for every $1 of profit

- Vs. S&amp;P 500 average P/E of 20

- Apple is 50% more expensive than average

- Why? Because Apple is high-quality company with strong competitive advantage



General Motors: Stock $40, EPS $8, P/E = 5

- Investors pay $5 for every $1 of profit

- Vs. S&amp;P 500 average P/E of 20

- GM is 75% cheaper than average

- Why? Because GM is mature, slow-growth, cyclical business

</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Interpret P/E:</strong></p>
<p>| P/E Level | Interpretation | Risk |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 0-10 | Very cheap (or company losing money) | Value trap risk |</p>
<p>| 10-15 | Cheap | Low downside risk |</p>
<p>| 15-25 | Fair value | Moderate |</p>
<p>| 25-40 | Expensive | Higher downside risk |</p>
<p>| 40+ | Very expensive | High downside risk |</p>
<p><strong>P/E Considerations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trailing P/E</strong>: Uses past 12 months of earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>More accurate (real earnings)</li>
<li>Less forward-looking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forward P/E</strong>: Uses estimated next 12 months of earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on analyst forecasts</li>
<li>More growth-oriented</li>
<li>Can be wrong if estimates miss</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Growth Stock Premium</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Company A (Mature):

- Current Earnings: $10

- Expected Future Earnings: $10.50 (5% growth)

- P/E: 20 (investors not paying much premium for slow growth)



Company B (Growth):

- Current Earnings: $1

- Expected Future Earnings: $2 (100% growth)

- P/E: 50 (investors pay premium for fast growth)



But Company B is riskier (growth might not materialize)

Company A is safer (stable but slow)

Both valuations can be appropriate depending on execution risk

</code></pre>
<h3>Ratio 2: P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> How many dollars investors pay for $1 of book value (assets minus liabilities per share).</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
P/B = Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share



Example:

Stock Price: $100

Book Value Per Share: $50

P/B = 100 ÷ 50 = 2.0



Interpretation: Paying 2x the book value

</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Interpret P/B:</strong></p>
<p>| P/B Level | Meaning |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| P/B < 1.0 | Stock trading below asset value (possible bargain or trouble sign) |</p>
<p>| P/B = 1.0-2.0 | Fair value |</p>
<p>| P/B = 2.0-5.0 | Expensive (especially for low-growth companies) |</p>
<p>| P/B > 5.0 | Very expensive (better for high-growth or high-return companies) |</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Asset-Heavy vs. Asset-Light</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bank:

- Stock Price: $100

- Book Value: $95 (lots of assets like loans, buildings)

- P/B: 1.05

- Fair for banking because value is in assets



Tech Software Company:

- Stock Price: $100

- Book Value: $10 (fewer physical assets, mostly people/IP)

- P/B: 10

- Fair for tech because value is in intellectual property, not assets



Same P/B ratio looks expensive for banks, cheap for tech companies

Context matters!

</code></pre>
<h3>Ratio 3: ROE (Return on Equity)</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> How much profit the company generates from shareholder equity (money invested).</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
ROE = Net Income ÷ Shareholders&#39; Equity



Example:

Net Income: $50M

Shareholders&#39; Equity: $500M

ROE = 50 ÷ 500 = 10% (or 0.10)



Interpretation: Company generates 10% return on shareholder capital

</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Interpret ROE:</strong></p>
<p>| ROE Level | Quality |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| ROE < 10% | Poor (money would grow faster in savings account) |</p>
<p>| ROE 10-15% | Average |</p>
<p>| ROE 15-20% | Good |</p>
<p>| ROE 20%+ | Excellent (great business model) |</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: ROE Comparison</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Company A:

- Net Income: $100M

- Shareholders&#39; Equity: $1000M

- ROE = 10%

- Interpretation: Average business, not great returns



Company B:

- Net Income: $100M

- Shareholders&#39; Equity: $500M

- ROE = 20%

- Interpretation: Excellent business, generating strong returns



Company B is better even though both have same profit

Because it&#39;s doing it with less shareholder capital (more efficient)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Historical ROE Leaders:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Apple: ROE ~80% (exceptional - uses debt, strong profits)

Microsoft: ROE ~30% (excellent)

Amazon: ROE ~15% (good but reinvesting for growth)

Bank of America: ROE ~10% (average for banks)

</code></pre>
<h3>Ratio 4: Debt-to-Equity</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> How much debt the company is using compared to equity (financial leverage).</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Shareholders&#39; Equity



Example:

Total Debt: $200M

Shareholders&#39; Equity: $500M

D/E = 200 ÷ 500 = 0.4



Interpretation: For every $1 of equity, company has $0.40 of debt

</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Interpret D/E:</strong></p>
<p>| D/E Ratio | Risk Level | Implication |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| D/E < 0.5 | Very safe | Conservative capital structure |</p>
<p>| D/E 0.5-1.0 | Safe | Moderate leverage |</p>
<p>| D/E 1.0-2.0 | Moderate Risk | Higher risk in downturns |</p>
<p>| D/E > 2.0 | High Risk | Vulnerable to economic stress |</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Debt Varies by Industry</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Tech Company:

- Debt: $1B

- Equity: $100B

- D/E: 0.01 (virtually no debt, very safe)



Bank:

- Debt: $800B

- Equity: $100B

- D/E: 8.0 (very high, but normal for banks)



Utility:

- Debt: $40B

- Equity: $60B

- D/E: 0.67 (moderate, typical for utilities)



Same D/E ratio means different things in different industries

Tech with high D/E = DANGEROUS

Banks with high D/E = NORMAL

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why D/E Matters:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
During Economic Boom:

- Low D/E: Stable, less profit

- High D/E: Higher profits (using leverage), riskier



During Recession:

- Low D/E: Can weather the storm

- High D/E: Debt payments become burden, risk of bankruptcy

</code></pre>
<h3>Combining the Four Ratios</h3>
<p><strong>Complete Valuation and Quality Picture:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
VALUATION (Is the stock cheap or expensive?)

→ P/E Ratio (price relative to profit)

→ P/B Ratio (price relative to assets)



QUALITY (Is this a good business?)

→ ROE (how much profit on shareholder capital)



FINANCIAL STRENGTH (Can they survive downturns?)

→ Debt-to-Equity (leverage risk)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Complete Analysis</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock A:

- P/E: 15 (cheap relative to market)

- P/B: 1.2 (fair value)

- ROE: 10% (average quality)

- D/E: 0.3 (very safe)

Interpretation: Cheap stock, average quality, safe

Good for: Conservative investors wanting value



Stock B:

- P/E: 35 (expensive relative to market)

- P/B: 4.0 (expensive)

- ROE: 25% (excellent quality)

- D/E: 0.5 (moderate leverage)

Interpretation: Expensive stock, excellent quality, safe

Good for: Growth investors willing to pay premium for quality



Stock C:

- P/E: 8 (very cheap)

- P/B: 0.5 (trading below book value)

- ROE: 3% (terrible quality)

- D/E: 2.5 (high debt, dangerous)

Interpretation: Cheap for a reason, poor business, risky

Danger: Value trap, potential bankruptcy

</code></pre>
<h3>Industry Variations</h3>
<p><strong>Ratios vary significantly by industry:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Banks (Citigroup):

- High D/E (8.0+) = NORMAL

- Moderate P/E (8-12) = TYPICAL

- Lower ROE (8-12%) = TYPICAL



Tech (Apple):

- Low D/E (0.5) = NORMAL

- Higher P/E (25-35) = TYPICAL

- Very High ROE (50%+) = TYPICAL



Utilities (Duke Energy):

- Moderate D/E (0.8) = NORMAL

- Lower P/E (12-15) = TYPICAL

- Moderate ROE (10-12%) = TYPICAL



Never compare ratios across industries directly

Always compare within industry

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Using P/E Alone</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Stock has low P/E so you buy. Later you learn company is in decline.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Combine P/E with ROE and growth rate. Low P/E only good if company is profitable and growing.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring the Industry Context</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tech stock has D/E of 1.5 which looks risky. But that's normal for tech.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always compare ratios to industry averages, not across industries.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Using Stale Data</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You use P/E from quarterly earnings, stock has rallied 20% since then.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Update your data before making decisions. Markets move fast.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Confusing High P/E with Expensive</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Stock has P/E of 40, so it's overpriced. But if it's growing 50%/year, maybe justified.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Consider growth rate. PEG ratio = P/E ÷ growth rate. Compare to 1.0 as benchmark.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Not Checking if Earnings Are Real</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Low P/E ratio looks great. But company has negative cash flow.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always verify earnings with cash flow statement. Earnings can be accounting fiction.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Using Ratios in Practice</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: Picking Between Two Dividend Stocks</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock A (Old Utility):

- P/E: 12

- P/B: 1.0

- ROE: 8%

- D/E: 0.7

- Dividend: 4%

Appeal: Very cheap, stable



Stock B (Growing Tech):

- P/E: 30

- P/B: 3.5

- ROE: 22%

- D/E: 0.3

- Dividend: 1%

Appeal: Quality, growing



Decision:

- If you want income: Choose A (4% dividend)

- If you want growth: Choose B (higher ROE, lower D/E safer)

- Risk tolerance: A safer (lower D/E), B riskier (growth dependent)

Both decisions defensible, depends on your needs

<h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Calculate Ratios</h3>
<p>Given this data for Company XYZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock Price: $50</li>
<li>EPS: $2.50</li>
<li>Book Value Per Share: $25</li>
<li>Net Income: $500M</li>
<li>Shareholders' Equity: $5,000M</li>
<li>Total Debt: $2,500M</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate:</p>
<ol>
<li>P/E Ratio: <strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</li>
<li>P/B Ratio: <strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</li>
<li>ROE: <strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</li>
<li>Debt-to-Equity: <strong></strong><strong></strong><em></em>_</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer Key:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>P/E = 50 ÷ 2.50 = 20</li>
<li>P/B = 50 ÷ 25 = 2.0</li>
<li>ROE = 500 ÷ 5000 = 10%</li>
<li>D/E = 2500 ÷ 5000 = 0.5</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 2: Interpret Ratios</h3>
<p>For your calculated ratios above, write brief interpretation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the stock expensive or cheap? (Compare P/E of 20 to market average of 18)</li>
<li>Is the book value reasonable? (Is P/B of 2.0 fair?)</li>
<li>Is the ROE good? (10% is average or excellent?)</li>
<li>Is the debt reasonable? (Is D/E of 0.5 safe?)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 3: Compare Companies</h3>
<p>Pick two companies in same industry (Apple vs. Microsoft, or Nike vs. Adidas):</p>
<ol>
<li>Get their most recent P/E, P/B, ROE, and D/E</li>
<li>Compare which is more expensive</li>
<li>Compare which has better quality (ROE)</li>
<li>Compare which is safer (D/E)</li>
<li>Which would you buy and why?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>✓ <strong>P/E Ratio</strong> = Valuation metric (cheap/expensive)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>P/B Ratio</strong> = Asset valuation (works better for asset-heavy companies)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>ROE</strong> = Quality metric (how efficiently company uses capital)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Debt-to-Equity</strong> = Risk metric (financial leverage and safety)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Compare to industry</strong> = Never compare ratios across different industries</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Historical trends</strong> = Better to look at 5-year average vs. single number</p>
<p>✓ <strong>All four matter</strong> = Use all four for complete picture</p>
