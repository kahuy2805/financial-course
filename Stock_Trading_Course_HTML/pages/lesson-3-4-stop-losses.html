<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to set stop losses that actually protect your capital without being so tight they exit on normal market noise. Stop losses are not optional - they are the execution mechanism for your risk management plan. By the end of this lesson, you'll know exactly where to place a stop loss for any trade and understand the reasoning behind placement.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 25-30 minutes</p>

<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>The Critical Truth About Stop Losses</h3>
<p><strong>Stop losses are not optional.</strong></p>
<p>Every professional trader uses them. Every. Single. One.</p>
<p>If you don't use a stop loss, you don't have a risk management plan. You're gambling.</p>
<p><strong>The Purpose of a Stop Loss:</strong></p>
<p>A stop loss is a predetermined point where you exit a losing trade BEFORE emotions take over.</p>
<p>It answers one crucial question that must be answered BEFORE you enter a trade:</p>
<blockquote><strong>"At what price level will I admit this trade was wrong and exit?"</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you can't answer this question before entering, don't enter.</p>
<h3>The Three Rules for Stop Loss Placement</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Based on Technical Analysis, Not Feelings</strong></p>
<p>Your stop loss should be placed at a level where the stock would prove your thesis wrong.</p>
<p>Common technical levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previous support levels</li>
<li>Moving averages (200-day, 50-day)</li>
<li>Trend line breaks</li>
<li>Fibonacci retracement levels</li>
<li>Round numbers (psychological levels)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Below Normal Volatility, But Not Too Tight</strong></p>
<p>A stop loss that's too tight gets hit on normal market noise and you're out of a trade that would have worked.</p>
<p>A stop loss that's too wide risks too much capital.</p>
<p>Finding the balance is the key skill.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: NEVER Adjust a Stop Loss to Save a Losing Trade</strong></p>
<p>Once you place a stop, it's a contract with yourself.</p>
<p>Adjusting stops (moving them wider) is where most traders lose substantial money.</p>
<p>The stop loss is sacred.</p>
<h3>Stop Loss Methods: The Professional Approaches</h3>
<p>#### Method 1: Technical Support Level</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong></p>
<p>A price level where the stock has "bounced" or "found support" previously.</p>
<p><strong>How to Identify:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the chart (daily or weekly timeframe)</li>
<li>Find previous lows or bounce points</li>
<li>These are natural support levels</li>
<li>Place stop 5-10% below that level for buffer</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Stock XYZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current price: $100</li>
<li>Previous support at $90 (stock bounced here 3 months ago)</li>
<li>Previous support at $85 (stock bounced here 6 months ago)</li>
<li>Entry price for your trade: $95</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stop Loss Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tight: $88 (just below recent support)</li>
<li>Medium: $83 (just below previous support)</li>
<li>Wide: $78 (giving extra buffer)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your choice depends on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How much capital you're risking (tighter = more capital at risk per position)</li>
<li>Your account size (small accounts need tighter stops)</li>
<li>How important this trade is to your thesis</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Method 2: Volatility-Based (ATR Method)</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong></p>
<p>ATR = Average True Range. This measures how much a stock typically moves daily.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find the ATR on your chart (most charting software shows this)</li>
<li>Multiply ATR by 2 (this gives you normal daily movement range)</li>
<li>Place stop 2× ATR below entry</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Stock ABC at $200:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATR = $3</li>
<li>Normal daily range = $3 × 2 = $6</li>
<li>Stop loss = $200 - $6 = $194</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>
<p>If the stock drops more than 2× its normal daily range, something is wrong. Exit.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>
<p>Automatically adjusts for volatility. Volatile stocks get wider stops. Calm stocks get tighter stops.</p>
<p>#### Method 3: Percentage-Based</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong></p>
<p>A fixed percentage below your entry price.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
<p>Set stop at a fixed % below entry, regardless of technical levels.</p>
<p><strong>Common Levels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive traders: 3-5% below entry</li>
<li>Moderate traders: 5-7% below entry</li>
<li>Conservative traders: 8-10% below entry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Entry: $100</p>
<p>Conservative stop (8%): $100 - $8 = $92</p>
<p>Moderate stop (5%): $100 - $5 = $95</p>
<p>Aggressive stop (3%): $100 - $3 = $97</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>
<p>Simple and consistent. Easy to remember.</p>
<p><strong>Downside:</strong></p>
<p>Ignores actual technical levels. You might stop out right before a support bounce.</p>
<p>#### Method 4: Moving Average Cross</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong></p>
<p>Use moving averages as dynamic support levels.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the stock's moving average (200-day for long-term, 50-day for medium-term)</li>
<li>Place stop just below the moving average</li>
<li>If stock closes below the moving average, exit</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Stock trading at $150:</p>
<ul>
<li>200-day moving average: $145</li>
<li>Entry: $150</li>
<li>Stop loss: $144 (just below the moving average)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>
<p>When a stock breaks below its major moving average, the trend has changed. Exit.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>
<p>Eliminates false signals from random dips. Based on trend analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Downside:</strong></p>
<p>Moving averages lag price. You might suffer a larger loss before the stop is hit.</p>
<h3>Stop Loss Placement: Detailed Examples</h3>
<p>#### Example 1: Swing Trade in Growth Stock</p>
<p><strong>Stock:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) at $250</p>
<p><strong>Your Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at daily chart</li>
<li>Recent support at $240</li>
<li>Older support at $230</li>
<li>ATR = $5</li>
<li>You believe in the uptrend above $240</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Buy at $250</p>
<p><strong>Stop Loss Decision:</strong></p>
<p>Option A: $240 (technical support) = 4% risk</p>
<p>Option B: $235 (ATR method: 250 - 5×2) = 2% risk</p>
<p>Option C: $238 (conservative, between methods) = 2.4% risk</p>
<p><strong>Your Choice: $240</strong> (respects the technical support level)</p>
<p><strong>Position Sizing with This Stop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account: $20,000</li>
<li>Risk: 1% = $200</li>
<li>Stop distance: $250 - $240 = $10</li>
<li>Position size: $200 ÷ $10 = 20 shares</li>
<li>Position value: $5,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop at actual support level (not arbitrary)</li>
<li>Risk is controlled (1% of account)</li>
<li>Position size is reasonable (25% of account)</li>
<li>If you're wrong, you exit at a price that says the trade thesis failed</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Example 2: Long-Term Investment Position</p>
<p><strong>Stock:</strong> Dividend blue-chip (JNJ) at $160</p>
<p><strong>Your Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at weekly chart</li>
<li>Long-term support at $150</li>
<li>Recent bounce off $155</li>
<li>You're buying for position trade (weeks to months)</li>
<li>ATR on weekly = $2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Buy at $160</p>
<p><strong>Stop Loss Decision:</strong></p>
<p>Option A: $150 (technical support) = 6.25% risk</p>
<p>Option B: $156 (ATR method: 160 - 2×2) = 2.5% risk</p>
<p>Option C: $145 (conservative) = 9.4% risk</p>
<p><strong>Your Choice: $150</strong> (respects long-term support, acceptable 6.25% loss for position trade)</p>
<p><strong>Position Sizing with This Stop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account: $25,000</li>
<li>Risk: 2% = $500</li>
<li>Stop distance: $160 - $150 = $10</li>
<li>Position size: $500 ÷ $10 = 50 shares</li>
<li>Position value: $8,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wider stop is acceptable for longer-term trade</li>
<li>Risk is controlled (2% of account)</li>
<li>Position size is reasonable (32% of account)</li>
<li>Stops out only if fundamental thesis breaks</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Example 3: High-Volatility Speculative Play</p>
<p><strong>Stock:</strong> Biotech startup (BIO) at $50</p>
<p><strong>Your Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very volatile stock</li>
<li>Recent high at $55</li>
<li>Support at $42</li>
<li>ATR = $3.50</li>
<li>Major news catalyst coming (FDA approval)</li>
<li>Very speculative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Buy at $50</p>
<p><strong>Stop Loss Decision:</strong></p>
<p>Option A: $42 (technical support) = 16% risk (TOO WIDE)</p>
<p>Option B: $43 (ATR method: 50 - 3.5×2) = 14% risk (STILL TOO WIDE)</p>
<p>Option C: $46 (percentage method: 8%) = 8% risk (ACCEPTABLE)</p>
<p><strong>Your Choice: $46</strong> (limiting downside despite volatility)</p>
<p><strong>Position Sizing with This Stop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account: $10,000</li>
<li>Risk: 1% = $100</li>
<li>Stop distance: $50 - $46 = $4</li>
<li>Position size: $100 ÷ $4 = 25 shares</li>
<li>Position value: $1,250</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For speculative play, tight stop is essential</li>
<li>Risk is controlled (1% of account)</li>
<li>Position is small (12.5% of account)</li>
<li>Limits damage if binary outcome is negative</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Tight Stop Loss Dilemma</h3>
<p><strong>Common Problem:</strong> Tight stops cause you to exit winning trades during normal pullbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Example of the Problem:</strong></p>
<p>You buy Apple at $150 with stop at $148 (tight stop).</p>
<p>Next day, market pulls back 1%, stock drops to $147.50.</p>
<p>Your stop gets hit.</p>
<p>Then the stock recovers to $155 over the next week.</p>
<p>You lost 1.5% on a trade that would have made 3.3% (now you missed the gain).</p>
<p><strong>The Solution: Use Technical Levels Instead of Arbitrary Tight Stops</strong></p>
<p>Don't just put a hard stop 2% below entry.</p>
<p>Instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a technical support level that makes sense</li>
<li>Place stop just below that level</li>
<li>Let the technical level guide your stop distance</li>
<li>Accept the risk that follows from the real technical setup</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example with Technical Placement:</strong></p>
<p>You buy Apple at $150.</p>
<p>Technical support at $148.</p>
<p>You place stop at $147.50 (just below support).</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<ul>
<li>If stock drops to $147.50, something technical changed = exit correctly</li>
<li>If stock pulls back to $148.50 but holds support, you stay in = correct</li>
<li>You're exiting on technical failure, not arbitrary price</li>
</ul>
<p>This stop is based on a reason. That matters.</p>
<h3>Stop Loss Adjustments: What's Allowed and What's Not</h3>
<p><strong>NEVER DO THIS: Move Stop Loss Wider to Avoid Loss</strong></p>
<p>Example of WRONG behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy at $100</li>
<li>You set stop at $95</li>
<li>Stock drops to $96</li>
<li>You think "I'll move stop to $90 to give it more room"</li>
</ul>
<p>This is emotional decision-making. It's how accounts get destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>ALLOWED: Move Stop Loss TIGHTER Once in Profit</strong></p>
<p>Once a trade moves into profit, you can tighten your stop (called a "trailing stop").</p>
<p>Example of RIGHT behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy at $100</li>
<li>Stop at $95</li>
<li>Stock rises to $108</li>
<li>You tighten stop to $102 (locking in $2 profit)</li>
<li>Now your worst case is +$2, not -$5</li>
</ul>
<p>This is risk management. This is professional.</p>
<p><strong>ALLOWED: Scaling Out on the Way Up</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a profit, you can close part of the position and let the rest run.</p>
<p>Example of RIGHT behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy 20 shares at $100, stop at $95</li>
<li>Stock rises to $110</li>
<li>You sell 10 shares at $110 = lock in $10 profit ($200)</li>
<li>Now hold 10 shares with stop at $105 (break-even)</li>
<li>Let remaining 10 ride for potential larger profit</li>
</ul>
<p>This is smart risk management.</p>
<h3>The Stop Loss Execution: Actual Implementation</h3>
<p>#### Method 1: Hard Stop Loss Order (Recommended for Beginners)</p>
<p>Most brokers call this a "stop loss order" or "stop order."</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You place a trade (e.g., buy 20 shares at $100)</li>
<li>You immediately place a stop loss order (e.g., sell 20 shares if price hits $95)</li>
<li>The broker monitors the price</li>
<li>If price hits $95, your order automatically executes</li>
<li>You're out of the trade</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic - no emotion</li>
<li>No monitoring required</li>
<li>Guaranteed exit level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On gap downs, you might get filled well below your stop (especially with small-cap stocks)</li>
<li>Stock can "touch" your stop and bounce back (rare, but happens)</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Method 2: Manual Stop Loss (For Advanced Traders)</p>
<p>You monitor the trade yourself and exit manually if needed.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You place a trade</li>
<li>You write down your stop loss level</li>
<li>You monitor the trade (daily or multiple times daily)</li>
<li>If it hits your stop, you manually sell</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility if something unexpected happens</li>
<li>Control over exact execution price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires discipline</li>
<li>Easy to "give it another day"</li>
<li>Emotional decisions creep in</li>
<li>Terrible option for beginners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation for You:</strong></p>
<p>Use hard stop loss orders. Let the system enforce discipline, not your willpower.</p>
<h3>Psychological Challenges with Stop Losses</h3>
<p>Stop losses test your conviction. Here are common mental tricks traders use to avoid them:</p>
<p><strong>Mental Trap 1: "I'll Just Wait and See"</strong></p>
<p>Your stop level is hit, but you don't sell because "I think it will bounce."</p>
<p>Result: Trade turns into larger loss.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Place a hard stop loss order. The decision is made before emotion hits.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Trap 2: "This Shouldn't Happen"</strong></p>
<p>Your stop hits. You think "but the fundamentals are good, the company is solid, this is just a pullback."</p>
<p>Result: You're out of losses but still down, and you're frustrated about "being stopped out of a winner."</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Understand that stops are about managing money, not predicting the future. Right stop = right decision regardless of outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Trap 3: "If I Exit Now, I'm a Loser"</strong></p>
<p>Taking a loss on a trade feels like personal failure. So you don't exit.</p>
<p>Result: Losses grow larger.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Every professional trader loses on trades. Professionals just lose small amounts. Exiting a loss early is proof of good risk management, not failure.</p>
<h3>Stop Loss Strategies for Different Traders</h3>
<p>#### Conservative Approach (Beginners)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop placement: Technical support level</li>
<li>Adjustment: Tighten only once profitable</li>
<li>Never scale: Use one position size only</li>
<li>Account risk: 1% per trade maximum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $100</li>
<li>Support at $92</li>
<li>Stop: $91</li>
<li>Account: $10,000</li>
<li>Risk: $100 (1%)</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Moderate Approach (Intermediate)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop placement: Technical level + volatility check</li>
<li>Adjustment: Tighten once in profit</li>
<li>Scaling: Scale out at 2× or 3× risk gained</li>
<li>Account risk: 1-2% per trade</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $100</li>
<li>Support at $92</li>
<li>ATR = $2</li>
<li>Stop: $90 (below support, respecting volatility)</li>
<li>Account: $15,000</li>
<li>Risk: $150 (1%)</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Aggressive Approach (Advanced)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop placement: Tight, technical levels only</li>
<li>Adjustment: Tighten stop frequently, trailing stops</li>
<li>Scaling: Scale out aggressively on quick wins</li>
<li>Account risk: 2% per trade, sometimes 3% on high-conviction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $100</li>
<li>Tight support at $96</li>
<li>Stop: $95 (very tight)</li>
<li>Account: $25,000</li>
<li>Risk: $500 (2%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Beginners should NOT use aggressive approach. Build skill with conservative approach first.</p>

<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Setting Your First Real Stop Loss</h3>
<p><strong>Your Situation:</strong></p>
<p>You've identified Apple (AAPL) for a trade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current price: $150</li>
<li>You want to enter at: $150</li>
<li>Your account: $15,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: Analyze the Chart</strong></p>
<p>You look at the daily chart of Apple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent high: $155</li>
<li>Recent low: $140</li>
<li>Previous major support: $145</li>
<li>Previous major support: $135</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Determine Technical Stop</strong></p>
<p>You think the trade makes sense above $145.</p>
<p>If it closes below $145, the setup is broken.</p>
<p>Stop loss: $144.50 (just below the support)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate Risk</strong></p>
<p>Entry: $150</p>
<p>Stop: $144.50</p>
<p>Risk per share: $5.50</p>
<p>Account: $15,000</p>
<p>1% risk: $150</p>
<p>Position size: $150 ÷ $5.50 = 27.27 shares (round to 27)</p>
<p>Position value: 27 × $150 = $4,050</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Verify Reasonableness</strong></p>
<p>Position is 27% of account = reasonable ✓</p>
<p>Risk is exactly 1% = acceptable ✓</p>
<p>Stop is based on technical level = good ✓</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Place the Trade</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Place order: "Buy 27 shares of AAPL at market"</li>
<li>Once filled, immediately place stop: "Sell 27 shares if price hits $144.50"</li>
<li>Never move that stop unless tightening it once profitable</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 6: Monitor</strong></p>
<p>Watch the trade. Manage it. If it goes in your favor, consider tightening the stop.</p>
<p>If it hits your stop = exit = correct decision, regardless of what happens next.</p>
<h3>Common Real-World Scenarios</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Stock Drops Sharply on News</strong></p>
<p>Your trade in ABC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $100</li>
<li>Stop: $95</li>
<li>Stock opens at $92 after bad earnings news</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens to your stop loss order?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your stop likely executes at around $92-94 (depending on broker)</li>
<li>You're out of the trade</li>
<li>You lost approximately 6-8% instead of your planned 5%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<p>This is acceptable slippage on a large gap. This is why you size smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Stock Touches Your Stop and Bounces Back</strong></p>
<p>Your trade in XYZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $100</li>
<li>Stop: $95</li>
<li>Stock drops to $94.80, hits your stop</li>
<li>Immediately bounces back to $102</li>
<li>You're out, thinking "ugh, I should have waited"</li>
</ul>
<p>What actually happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>You made the RIGHT decision with the RIGHT stop</li>
<li>The fact that it bounced back doesn't change that</li>
<li>Over 100 trades, this happens a few times</li>
<li>But it saves you on the trades where there's no bounce</li>
</ul>
<p><em></em>Scenario 3: Stop Loss is Triggered While Sleeping (Overnight Gap)</p>
<p>Your trade in TSLA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry: $250</li>
<li>Stop: $245</li>
<li>You're holding overnight</li>
<li>Company announces bad news after hours</li>
<li>Stock opens at $230 next morning</li>
<li>Your stop gets executed at $230 (significant slippage from $245)</li>
</ul>
<p>What happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your stop worked, but with slippage</li>
<li>You lost 8% instead of 2%</li>
<li>This is a risk of holding overnight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your response:</strong></p>
<p>Either accept the overnight risk or trade shorter-term with tighter positions.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Setting Stop Loss Too Tight</h3>
<p><strong>What Traders Do Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>"I'll just put my stop 1% below entry. That's tight risk management."</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>Normal market volatility is often 2-3%. You get stopped out on noise, missing winning trades.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Way:</strong></p>
<p>Base stop on technical levels, not arbitrary percentages.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Setting Stop Loss Too Wide</h3>
<p><strong>What Traders Do Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>"I'll put my stop 10% below entry. That gives the trade room to work."</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>10% loss is massive. You're risking too much per trade.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Way:</strong></p>
<p>Base stop on technical levels. If they require 10% risk, the trade doesn't fit your position sizing.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Not Setting a Stop Loss at All</h3>
<p><strong>What Traders Do Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>"I'll just watch it and exit if it goes wrong."</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>Discipline vanishes when money is on the line. You'll convince yourself to hold through losses.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Way:</strong></p>
<p>Place a hard stop loss order immediately after entry.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Moving Your Stop Loss Wider</h3>
<p><strong>What Traders Do Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>"It hit $98, I'm down 2%. I'll move my stop to $90 to give it more room."</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>This is emotional decision-making. You're throwing away your plan because of temporary discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Way:</strong></p>
<p>Your stop is sacred. Never adjust it wider. Only tighten once profitable.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Using a "Mental Stop Loss"</h3>
<p><strong>What Traders Do Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>"I know my stop is at $95, but I won't actually set the order. I'll just remember it."</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>When the stock hits $95 and is dropping fast, you'll convince yourself to hold. Mental discipline fails under stress.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Way:</strong></p>
<p>Place an actual stop loss order with your broker immediately.</p>

<h2>Quick Review</h2>
<p><strong>Why Stop Losses Matter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They enforce your exit plan before emotion takes over</li>
<li>They limit losses to manageable amounts</li>
<li>They're the execution mechanism for position sizing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Set Stop Losses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use technical support levels (preferred method)</li>
<li>Or use volatility-based methods (ATR)</li>
<li>Or use consistent percentage-based approaches</li>
<li>Base on actual market structure, not arbitrary prices</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Sacred Rule:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once set, a stop loss is a contract with yourself</li>
<li>Never move it wider</li>
<li>Only tighten it once profitable</li>
<li>Let it execute without emotion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use hard stop loss orders (not mental stops)</li>
<li>Set immediately after entry</li>
<li>Never "watch and decide later"</li>
<li>Accept the occasional whipsaw as the cost of discipline</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Identifying Support Levels</h3>
<p>For each chart below, identify at least 2 potential support levels where you'd place a stop loss:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stock ABC:</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Current price: $100</p>
<p>   - Recent bounce off: $92</p>
<p>   - Older bounce off: $82</p>
<p>   - What support level would you use? $<strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Your stop loss would be: $<strong></strong>_ (slightly below support)</p>
<ol>
<li>Stock XYZ:</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Current price: $75</p>
<p>   - Recent low: $70</p>
<p>   - Previous low: $65</p>
<p>   - What support level would you use? $<strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Your stop loss would be: $<strong></strong>_</p>
<h3>Exercise 2: Stop Loss Calculation with Position Sizing</h3>
<p>For each scenario, calculate the stop loss, position size, and verify the risk:</p>
<p><strong>Setup 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account: $15,000</li>
<li>Stock: Apple at $150</li>
<li>Technical support: $145</li>
<li>Planned stop: $144</li>
<li>Risk per share: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>1% of account: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>Position size: <strong></strong>_ shares (Risk ÷ Risk per share)</li>
<li>Position value: $<strong></strong>_</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setup 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account: $20,000</li>
<li>Stock: Tesla at $250</li>
<li>Technical support: $240</li>
<li>Planned stop: $238</li>
<li>Risk per share: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>1% of account: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>Position size: <strong></strong>_ shares</li>
<li>Position value: $<strong></strong>_</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise 3: Stop Loss Discipline</h3>
<p>For each scenario, decide if the action is correct or incorrect:</p>
<ol>
<li>You buy at $100, stop at $95. Stock drops to $97. You move stop to $92.</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Correct/Incorrect: <strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Why: <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<ol>
<li>You buy at $100, stop at $95. Stock rises to $105. You tighten stop to $102.</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Correct/Incorrect: <strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Why: <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<ol>
<li>You buy at $100 with $200 at-risk. Stock hits $95, your stop executes.</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Correct/Incorrect: <strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Why: <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<ol>
<li>You plan to set a stop at $95 but decide to "just monitor it manually."</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Correct/Incorrect: <strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<p>   - Why: <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>_</p>
<h3>Exercise 4: Real Scenario Planning</h3>
<p>You have a $12,000 account. You want to trade Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current price: $300</li>
<li>Previous support: $290</li>
<li>Older support: $280</li>
<li>You want to use 1.5% risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your risk amount: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>Your planned technical stop loss: $<strong></strong>_ (just below support)</li>
<li>Your risk per share: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>Your position size: <strong></strong>_ shares</li>
<li>Your position value: $<strong></strong>_</li>
<li>Would you proceed with this trade? Yes/No (explain if no)</li>
</ol>
