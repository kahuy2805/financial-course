<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lesson, you'll discover what stock exchanges are, how they work, and why they matter. You'll learn about the major exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ, understand how trades happen in milliseconds, and see why these institutions are the backbone of modern investing. By the end, you'll understand exactly how your buy order gets matched with a seller.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 15-20 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lesson 1.1: What is the Stock Market (completed)</li>
<li>Understanding that stocks are company ownership pieces</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of supply and demand</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>What is a Stock Exchange?</h3>
<p>Imagine you want to sell your bicycle. You could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post it on Craigslist and wait for someone interested</li>
<li>Take it to a bike shop that matches buyers and sellers</li>
<li>List it on eBay where thousands of people can see it and bid</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A stock exchange is like option #3 for stocks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stock Exchange</strong>: A marketplace where stocks and other securities are bought and sold between investors through a centralized, organized system.</p>
<h3>The Simple Analogy</h3>
<p>Think of a stock exchange like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A farmers market</strong>: One location where many buyers and sellers meet to trade</li>
<li><strong>A car auction</strong>: Organized system where buyers bid, prices fluctuate, and transactions happen</li>
<li><strong>A currency exchange</strong>: Central hub where people trade one thing (dollars) for another (euros)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is that stock exchanges operate electronically now, happening across computer networks globally instead of one physical location.</p>
<h3>How Stock Exchanges Solve a Problem</h3>
<p>Before organized exchanges, buying stocks was incredibly difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you find someone willing to sell you their shares?</li>
<li>What price is fair when you finally find someone?</li>
<li>How do you trust the transaction?</li>
<li>How long does it take to complete?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A stock exchange solves all these problems by:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a central location (physical or electronic)</li>
<li>Organizing standardized rules</li>
<li>Matching buyers with sellers automatically</li>
<li>Executing trades in seconds</li>
<li>Clearing and settling transactions</li>
<li>Maintaining security and trust</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Major Stock Exchanges in the USA</h3>
<p>#### NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)</p>
<p><strong>The Giant:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 1792 (over 230 years old!)</li>
<li>Location: 11 Wall Street, New York City</li>
<li>Stocks listed: ~2,400 companies</li>
<li>Market cap: ~$28 trillion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What it trades:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks of large, established companies (blue-chip stocks)</li>
<li>Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola</li>
<li>Also called the "Big Board"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Physical Reality:</strong></p>
<p>You've probably seen photos of the iconic trading floor with traders shouting and gesturing. These exist, but modern trading is mostly electronic. When you place a stock order today, computers handle the matching automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>The "opening bell" at NYSE still happens each morning at 9:30 AM. Executives and celebrities ring a bell to officially open trading. It's tradition combined with ceremonial importance.</p>
<p>#### NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation)</p>
<p><strong>The Tech Hub:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 1971 (electronic exchange from the start)</li>
<li>Location: Times Square, New York City</li>
<li>Stocks listed: ~3,300 companies</li>
<li>Market cap: ~$35 trillion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What it trades:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Technology-heavy companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Google)</li>
<li>More growth-oriented and smaller companies</li>
<li>More likely to list newer, innovative companies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Difference:</strong></p>
<p>NASDAQ is fully electronic with no traditional trading floor like NYSE. Trades happen entirely through computer networks.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>When Apple became more valuable than Microsoft, it shifted the balance of power between exchanges. NASDAQ now hosts larger market cap companies than NYSE overall.</p>
<h3>How a Stock Trade Actually Happens</h3>
<p>Let me walk you through a real trade step-by-step:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: You Place an Order</strong></p>
<p>You decide to buy 10 shares of Apple at $150 per share.</p>
<p>You enter this order into your broker's app or website.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Your Order Reaches the Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Your broker sends your order to the stock exchange (through complex electronic systems).</p>
<p>The exchange's computers check: Is Apple trading? Is the price available?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: The Matching Engine</strong></p>
<p>The exchange's matching engine is an incredible computer system that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sees all buy orders (people wanting to buy Apple)</li>
<li>Sees all sell orders (people wanting to sell Apple)</li>
<li>Automatically matches them based on price and time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your order at $150 goes into the queue. If someone else is selling at $150, you're matched immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Execution</strong></p>
<p>The trade executes - the system confirms:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy 10 shares at $150 ($1,500 total)</li>
<li>A seller sells 10 shares at $150</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Clearing and Settlement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The exchange confirms the trade details</li>
<li>Your broker receives the shares</li>
<li>Seller's broker receives the money</li>
<li>Money leaves your account</li>
<li>Shares appear in your portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: You Own the Stock</strong></p>
<p>Within 1-2 business days (called T+2 settlement), the transaction is officially complete.</p>
<p><strong>Time Frame:</strong></p>
<p>All this happens in milliseconds. Your order can be executed, cleared, and settled faster than you can blink.</p>
<h3>The Bid-Ask Spread</h3>
<p>When you check a stock price, you actually see TWO prices:</p>
<p><strong>Bid Price</strong>: The highest price someone is willing to PAY for the stock</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: $149.95</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ask Price</strong>: The lowest price someone is willing to SELL the stock</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: $150.05</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Spread</strong>: The difference between bid and ask</p>
<ul>
<li>$150.05 - $149.95 = $0.10 spread</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to BUY quickly, you accept the ask price ($150.05)</li>
<li>If you want to SELL quickly, you accept the bid price ($149.95)</li>
<li>Market makers profit from this spread</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>For popular stocks like Apple, the spread might be just $0.01. For less popular stocks, it might be $0.50 or more. This difference matters when you're trading.</p>
<h3>Trading Hours</h3>
<p><strong>Standard Trading Hours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time</li>
<li>Monday through Friday</li>
<li>The "regular trading session"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extended Hours Trading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM</li>
<li>After-hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM</li>
<li>Lower volume, wider spreads, more risky</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Closures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weekends</li>
<li>U.S. holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Independence Day, etc.)</li>
<li>Some shortened days (day before Thanksgiving, day after Christmas)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Orders Used at Exchanges</h3>
<p>#### Market Order</p>
<p>"Buy 10 shares of Apple at whatever price it's trading right now"</p>
<ul>
<li>Executes immediately</li>
<li>Price guaranteed, quantity guaranteed</li>
<li>But you don't know exact price</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Limit Order</p>
<p>"Buy 10 shares of Apple, but only at $150 or lower"</p>
<ul>
<li>Won't execute unless your price is met</li>
<li>Gives you price control</li>
<li>But might not execute if price never reaches your limit</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Stop-Loss Order</p>
<p>"Sell my 10 Apple shares if the price drops to $145"</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps protect against losses</li>
<li>Executes automatically if price hits the trigger</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Why Stock Exchanges Matter to You</h3>
<p><strong>1. Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>Without exchanges, you'd be stuck with your stock. You couldn't sell it easily. Exchanges ensure you can buy and sell whenever the market is open.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>You can sell 10 shares of Apple in seconds during market hours. Without the NYSE/NASDAQ system, this could take weeks.</p>
<p><strong>2. Fair Pricing</strong></p>
<p>With millions of buyers and sellers, prices reflect what stocks are truly worth. This prevents fraud and manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>If a company's earnings double, the stock price adjusts automatically through supply and demand at the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>3. Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Computers matching orders automatically means trades happen instantly instead of through phone calls and negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, traders used to physically run papers between offices. Today, millions of trades happen per second electronically.</p>
<h3>Understanding Market Capitalization</h3>
<p>Stock exchanges rank companies by market cap:</p>
<p><strong>Market Cap Formula:</strong></p>
<p>Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding = Market Cap</p>
<p><strong>Real Examples (approximate):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple: $180 × 15 billion shares = $2.7 trillion</li>
<li>Microsoft: $420 × 8.5 billion shares = $3.6 trillion</li>
<li>Small cap company: $50 × 10 million shares = $500 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>Large-cap stocks (like Apple, Microsoft) tend to be more stable. Small-cap stocks tend to be riskier but have more growth potential.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Thinking the Stock Market Closes for Everyone</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: The U.S. market closes at 4 PM, but global markets continue. You can trade during extended hours, though prices are less reliable.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Believing All Exchanges are the Same</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: NYSE and NASDAQ differ in what companies they list, their history, and their trading mechanisms. Know which exchange your stock trades on.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Assuming Your Market Order Will Get the Best Price</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: With fast market movements, the exact price you'll get may differ from the quoted price. Use limit orders if you need a specific price.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Thinking the Stock Exchange Controls Stock Prices</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: The exchange is neutral infrastructure. Stock prices are determined by supply and demand from investors, not the exchange itself.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Forgetting About Extended Hours Risks</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Trading outside 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM means fewer traders, wider spreads, and less reliable pricing. Avoid this when starting out.</p>
