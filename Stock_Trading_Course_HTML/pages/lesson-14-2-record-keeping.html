                <h1>Lesson 14.2: Record Keeping and Tax Reporting</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You think you won money, but without proper records, you don't know. Worse, the IRS can demand 7 years of documentation. Complete, organized record-keeping separates professional traders from casual gamblers.</p>
<h2>The IRS Audit Reality</h2>
<h3>What Triggers Audits</h3>
<pre><code>
Risk Factors for Traders:

HIGH RISK:

✓ Net operating losses (claiming business loss)

✓ Frequent trades with minimal gains

✓ Trading income dramatically higher/lower than last year

✓ No documentation of strategy

✓ Messy, disorganized records



MODERATE RISK:

✓ Self-employed trader classification

✓ Claiming home office deduction

✓ High trading volume (1000+ trades/year)

✓ Significant deductions



LOW RISK:

✓ Long-term capital gains only

✓ Dividend income

✓ Organized records and documentation

✓ Consistent strategy year-to-year



If audited: IRS will ask for 7 years of:

- Trade documentation

- Commissions and fees

- Education expenses

- Home office records

- Profit calculations

- Business plan documentation

</code></pre>
<h3>Consequences of Poor Records</h3>
<pre><code>
Scenario: IRS audits your 2022 returns



With complete records:

You have: Trade logs, broker statements, 1099s

Outcome: Audit completed, minor adjustments (if any)

Cost: Accountant fees (~$1,000-3,000)



Without records:

IRS estimates your income based on deposits

You claimed $30,000 profit but received $50,000 deposits

IRS says: &quot;Profit is likely $50,000&quot;

You: Unable to document otherwise

Result: Additional $20,000 in taxable income

        Taxes owed: $4,800+ (24% of $20k)

        Plus interest and penalties: $1,200+

Total cost: $6,000+ for missing records

Backup for tax reporting

</code></pre>
<h2>Tax Form Preparation</h2>
<h3>Form 8949: Sales of Securities</h3>
<pre><code>
IRS Form 8949 Required If: Broker 1099-B doesn&#39;t match your records



Your task:

1. Get 1099-B from broker (Forms 1099-B are notoriously error-prone)

2. Compare to your trade log

3. Report ALL trades on Form 8949



Each trade needs:

- Description (100 shares of Apple)

- Date acquired

- Date sold

- Proceeds (what you received)

- Cost basis (what you paid)

- Gain or loss



Example entry:

Description: 100 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Date Acquired: 1/5/2024

Date Sold: 1/15/2024

Proceeds: $19,000

Cost: $18,000

Gain: $1,000



This gets totaled and rolled into Schedule D

</code></pre>
<h3>Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses</h3>
<pre><code>
Part I: Short-Term Capital Gains and Losses

- Enter all ST trades from Form 8949

- Total ST gains: $________

- Total ST losses: $________

- Net ST gain/loss: $________



Part II: Long-Term Capital Gains and Losses

- Enter all LT trades from Form 8949

- Total LT gains: $________

- Total LT losses: $________

- Net LT gain/loss: $________



Line 16: Combine ST and LT results

If gain: Taxed at appropriate rate

If loss: Can deduct $3,000 against income, rest carries forward



Example:

Line 12 (ST net): -$2,000 (loss)

Line 20 (LT net): +$15,000 (gain)

Line 21 (Total): +$13,000 (taxable capital gain)



You pay tax on $13,000 at LT rate (15%)

Tax: $1,950

</code></pre>
<h3>Critical: 1099-B Accuracy Check</h3>
<pre><code>
BROKER ERRORS ARE COMMON!



Red flags to check:

1. Proceeds calculation wrong

   ✗ Entered gross instead of net (minus commission)

   ✗ Entered wrong price



2. Cost basis missing

   ✗ Shows $0 cost basis

   ✗ Outdated holdings shown



3. Holding period wrong

   ✗ Marked as ST when should be LT

   ✗ Date discrepancies



How to fix:

1. Compare broker&#39;s 1099-B to your trade log

2. If errors found: Contact broker (usually corrected within days)

3. If not fixed before filing: File Form 8949 with corrections

4. Attach explanation to your return



Example:

Broker reported:

Proceeds: $19,000, Cost basis: $0 (ERROR!)

You enter on 8949:

Proceeds: $19,000, Cost basis: $18,000 (Your records)

Result: Your gain of $1,000 vs. broker&#39;s $19,000



Without correction: You owe tax on extra $18,000!

</code></pre>
<h2>Dividend and Interest Record Keeping</h2>
<h3>Tracking Dividends</h3>
<p><strong>What to document:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
For each dividend received:



Company: ________________

Ticker: ________________

Ex-Dividend Date: ________________

Pay Date: ________________

Dividend per Share: $________

Shares Held: ________

Total Dividend: $________

Qualified Y/N: ☐ YES  ☐ NO (REITs, preferred)



Qualified dividend checklist:

✓ From US company stock OR qualified foreign corporation

✓ Held stock 60+ days around ex-dividend date

✓ Not holding short-against-box

✓ Not dividend from money market fund or money market account



Reinvested Y/N: ☐ YES (adds to cost basis)  ☐ NO (cash in hand)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Annual Dividend Summary:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year: 2024



Qualified Dividends: $__________  (Taxed at 0/15/20%)

Non-Qualified Dividends: $__________ (Taxed as ordinary income)



Form 1099-DIV will show:

Box 1a: Ordinary dividends (report on Line 5b Sched. 1)

Box 1b: Qualified dividends (report on Form 1040 - Schedule D)

Box 5: Non-dividend distributions (return of capital - adjust basis)



Common errors on 1099-DIV:

- Qualified marked as ordinary

- Non-qualifying marked as qualified

- Return of capital incorrectly reported

</code></pre>
<h2>Professional Trader Deductions</h2>
<h3>If You're a Business (Not Just an Investor)</h3>
<p><strong>Deductible Expenses:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Software and Data:

- Trading software subscriptions: $500-3,000/year

- Bloomberg terminal: $20,000+/year (if serious)

- Data feeds and research: $1,000+/year

- Market news subscriptions: $500+/year

Example: $2,500/year legitimate



Education and Training:

- Trading courses: $500-5,000

- Workshops and seminars: $1,000-3,000

- Books and publications: $200-500

- Continuing education: $1,000+/year

Example: $2,000/year legitimate



Technology:

- Computer purchases: depreciated over 5 years

- Monitor/peripherals: expensed or depreciated

- Internet service: Portion allocable to trading (50%?)

Example: $1,000+ year 1 (or depreciation in later years)



Office Space:

- Home office deduction: $5/sq. ft. or actual method

- Dedicated trading room: 200 sq. ft. × $5 = $1,000/year

Example: $1,000-2,000/year



Professional Services:

- CPA/accountant fees: $2,000-5,000/year

- Trading coach/mentor: $500-5,000/year

Example: $3,000/year



Office Supplies:

- Paper, filing, office equipment: $200-500/year

- All with receipts



Total Annual Deductions: $9,500-20,000+



Tax savings: $9,500 × 24% = $2,280

MEANINGFUL!

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Dangerous Deductions to Avoid:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
DON&#39;T claim (high audit risk):

✗ Travel costs (inherently personal vs. business)

✗ Meals and entertainment (too discretionary)

✗ Car expenses (unless purely business)

✗ Home office if not dedicated space

✗ Personal expenses disguised as business



The IRS scrutinizes:

- Home office for traders (they doubt legitimacy)

- Travel to &quot;trading conferences&quot;

- High meal expenses

- Vehicle expenses for traders



STRATEGY: Only claim clear, documented, legitimate expenses

A $2,000 deduction that passes audit beats a $5,000

that creates audit and penalties

</code></pre>
<h2>Recordkeeping Audit-Proofing</h2>
<h3>Documentation That Protects You</h3>
<p><strong>The Defensive File:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
What to keep to survive an audit:



1. Written Trading Plan (5-10 pages)

   - Your documented strategy

   - Entry/exit rules

   - Risk management

   - Time horizon

   - Shows this is systematic, not gambling



2. Trading Journal

   - Why you entered each trade

   - Your reasoning at the time

   - Shows thoughtful process

   - Not random picking



3. Track Record

   - Monthly P&amp;L reports

   - Annual income calculations

   - Consistency demonstrates professionalism

   - 3+ years shows this is serious business



4. Education Documentation

   - Certificates from courses

   - Books purchased (receipts)

   - Seminar attendance records

   - Shows commitment to skill development



5. Software/Subscription Receipts

   - All trading software with dates/amounts

   - Professional data services

   - Clearly necessary for business



6. Business Organization

   - If LLC/S-Corp: Articles of incorporation

   - Business license

   - Business bank account (not personal!)

   - Shows legitimate business



Together: Creates &quot;professional trader&quot; narrative

Audit defense: &quot;Here&#39;s my documented business&quot;

vs.

Just trades: &quot;Here are my stock trades&quot;

</code></pre>
<h2>Monthly and Annual Reconciliation</h2>
<h3>Month-End Checklist</h3>
<pre><code>
Every month:



☐ Download broker statements (save as PDF)

☐ Update master trade log

  - New trades entered

  - Closing trades marked with exit date/price

  - Gain/loss calculated

☐ Update dividend record

  - All dividends received noted

  - Qualified status determined

☐ Review commission costs

  - Are they reasonable?

  - Any surprises?

☐ Backup all files (cloud + external drive)

☐ Reconcile:

  - Your trade log total vs. broker statement total

  - Any discrepancies flagged



Monthly time investment: 1-2 hours

Annual time investment: 15-25 hours

Worth it to prevent: $5,000-50,000+ in tax issues

</code></pre>
<h3>Year-End Process</h3>
<pre><code>
December 31st / January:



WEEK 1 (Last week of December):

☐ Download final broker statements

  - Total interest income

  - Total deductible expenses



WEEK 3 (Mid January):
