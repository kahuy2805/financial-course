                <h1>Lesson 14.3: Building Your Trading Business Plan</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Most traders are hobbyists with no plan. Professional traders have documented businesses. A business plan transforms trading from gambling into an enterprise with defined objectives, strategies, and metrics. It's the difference between "I hope I make money" and "Here's exactly how I'll make money."</p>
<h2>Why You Need a Business Plan</h2>
<h3>The Difference</h3>
<p><strong>Without a Plan (Hobbyist):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
&quot;I&#39;m going to make money trading stocks&quot;

- No defined strategy

- Trades based on gut feeling

- No risk management

- Returns vary wildly (+50% one month, -30% next)

- Frequently changes approach

- No documentation

- Average result: Break-even or slight loss

- Tax complications (is this business or hobby?)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>With a Plan (Professional):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
&quot;I execute 15-25 swing trades monthly, targeting 2-3% per trade,

risking 1% per trade, holding 3-10 days, using price action +

volume analysis. Expected return: 10-15%/year. I track every trade,

measure Sharpe ratio, and adjust only when tested system fails.&quot;



- Defined, testable strategy

- Consistent entry/exit rules

- Strict risk management

- Predictable performance

- Evolution based on data, not emotion

- Full documentation

- Professional tax treatment

- Average result: Consistent profitability

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Position Sizing:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
My Position Sizing Rules:



Account Risk Rule:

Risk per trade: 1% of account maximum

Example: $10,000 account → Risk $100 per trade



Position Size Calculation:

Entry price: $________

Stop loss price: $________

Loss per share: Entry - Stop = $______

Risk per trade: $100 (your 1%)

Position size: $100 / $______ per share = ______ shares



Formula for any trade:

Number of shares = (Account size × 0.01) / (Entry - Stop)



Examples:

$5,000 account, $50 entry, $49 stop = 5 shares

$20,000 account, $100 entry, $98 stop = 100 shares

$100,000 account, $200 entry, $195 stop = 200 shares



This ensures my risk is consistent regardless of stock price

<h2>Business Structure Decision</h2>
<h3>Sole Proprietor vs. LLC vs. S-Corp</h3>
<pre><code>
SOLE PROPRIETOR:

Structure: Your personal business (simplest)

Tax treatment: Personal tax return (Schedule C)

Self-employment tax: Full 15.3%

Liability: Personal—all business liability is your liability

Cost: Minimal ($0-100)

Good for: Part-time traders, low income ($30k-50k)

Tax paid: Annual



LLC (Limited Liability Company):

Structure: Business entity separate from you

Tax treatment: Pass-through (Schedule C or corporate)

Self-employment tax: Can be reduced with S-election

Liability: Protected (business issues don&#39;t become personal)

Cost: Setup $500-2,000, annual $300-1,000

Good for: Full-time traders, growing business

Tax advantage: Slight over sole proprietor



S-CORP:

Structure: Corporation with special tax election

Tax treatment: Corporate with S-election

Self-employment tax: Can be significantly reduced

  (Take salary: $50,000 + distributions $30,000)

  (Only salary subjects to SE tax, not all distributions)

Liability: Maximum protection

Cost: Setup $1,500-3,000, annual filing $500-2,000, accounting $2,000-4,000

Good for: Successful full-time traders earning $100k+

Tax savings: Can be $5,000-15,000+/year



DECISION FRAMEWORK:



Annual trading income &lt; $50,000:

→ Sole proprietor (simplest, lowest cost)



Annual trading income $50,000-100,000:

→ LLC (some liability protection, minimal complexity)



Annual trading income &gt; $100,000:

→ S-Corp (tax savings exceed accounting costs)



If you&#39;re unsure: Start with sole proprietor, migrate to LLC as income grows
