                <h1>Lesson 13.4: Tax-Efficient Trading Strategies</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Taxes are your biggest drag on returns—often larger than investment fees. A successful investor manages tax liability as carefully as asset allocation. The IRS wants its cut, but you can be smart about when and how you pay.</p>
<h2>Tax Basics for Traders</h2>
<h3>Capital Gains Types</h3>
<p><strong>Short-Term Capital Gains (Assets held ≤ 1 year)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Tax Rate: Ordinary income rates (10%-37% federal, plus state)

Example: Sell stock after 6 months for $5,000 gain

         Your marginal rate: 24%

         Tax owed: $5,000 × 24% = $1,200



Effective Rate Examples (Federal Only):

$50,000 income:  22% tax = $1,100 on $5,000 gain

$100,000 income: 24% tax = $1,200 on $5,000 gain

$300,000 income: 35% tax = $1,750 on $5,000 gain

(Plus state taxes, additional 3.8% Net Investment Tax)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (Assets held > 1 year)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Tax Rates: 0%, 15%, or 20% (much better!)

Example: Sell stock after 14 months for $5,000 gain

         Your bracket: 15%

         Tax owed: $5,000 × 15% = $750 (vs. $1,200 short-term)

         SAVINGS: $450 per $5,000 gain!



Rate Brackets (2024, federal):

0% rate:    Income up to ~$47,000 (single)

15% rate:   Income $47,000-$518,900

20% rate:   Income over $518,900



Effective Tax Savings:

Short-term 24% → Long-term 15% = 9% saving per dollar

Short-term 35% → Long-term 20% = 15% saving per dollar

Short-term 37% → Long-term 20% = 17% saving per dollar

</code></pre>
<h3>Dividend Tax Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Qualified Dividends</strong> (from US stocks held 60+ days)</p>
<pre><code>
Taxed as long-term capital gains (0%, 15%, or 20%)

Most common for dividend stocks

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Non-Qualified Dividends</strong> (from REITs, preferred stock, foreign stocks)</p>
<pre><code>
Taxed as ordinary income (10%-37%)

More expensive tax-wise

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tax Impact Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
$5,000 in Qualified Dividends @ 15% bracket:  $750 tax

$5,000 in Non-Qualified Dividends @ 24%:      $1,200 tax

DIFFERENCE: $450 (36% more expensive!)

</code></pre>
<h2>Tax-Loss Harvesting: The #1 Tax Strategy</h2>
<h3>Basic Concept</h3>
<pre><code>
Definition: Sell losing positions to realize losses,

which offset gains elsewhere



Example:

Gain from Apple stock: +$3,000 (taxable)

Loss from Tesla position: -$2,000 (deductible)

Net gain: $1,000 (only this is taxed)

Tax savings: $2,000 × 24% = $480!

</code></pre>
<h3>Harvesting Workflow</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Identify Losses</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Portfolio Review:

Position        Cost Basis   Current Value   Gain/Loss

Apple          $10,000      $11,500         +$1,500 (DON&#39;T harvest)

Tesla          $5,000       $3,500          -$1,500 (HARVEST)

Google         $8,000       $7,200          -$800 (HARVEST)

Microsoft      $6,000       $9,000          +$3,000 (DON&#39;T harvest)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Calculate Offset Potential</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Available losses: $1,500 + $800 = $2,300

Planned gains (from selling Apple): $1,500



Strategy:

1. Harvest Tesla loss ($1,500) → Offset Apple gain

2. Save Tesla loss ($800) for next year



Result: Zero tax on the $1,500 gain!

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Execute Harvest Trades</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Action Sequence:

1. Sell Tesla at $3,500 (realize $1,500 loss)

2. Wait 31+ days

3. Buy similar (but not identical) stock/ETF

   Alternative: Buy different diversified tech holding



4. Sell Apple at $11,500 (realize $1,500 gain)

5. Total tax: $0 (loss offset gain)



Cost: Small commission (typically $0-5) and small price drift

</code></pre>
<h3>Wash Sale Rule (Critical!)</h3>
<p><strong>The Rule:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Can&#39;t deduct a loss if you buy substantially identical

security within 30 days BEFORE or 30 days AFTER the sale



If you violate: Loss is deferred (added to new cost basis)

Does NOT go away, just postponed

</code></pre>
<p><strong>30-Day Window Visualization:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
           30 days    SELL    30 days

           BEFORE    DATE    AFTER

           |---------|--------|---------|

    Can&#39;t buy    Loss harvest    Can&#39;t buy

    similar stock date here    similar stock



Total &quot;safe zone&quot;: Sell, wait 31 days, buy same security

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Avoiding Wash Sales:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Sold at loss:       DO NOT BUY:          CAN BUY:

Apple stock         Apple stock          Microsoft (diff company)

                    Apple options        Tech ETF (different holdings)

                                        Apple in DIFFERENT account



S&amp;P 500 Index      S&amp;P 500 Index        Total Market Index

(VOO)              (SPY, IVV)           (VTI) - different index

                                        Russell 3000 (broader)



High-yield bonds   Same bond ETF        Different bond ETF

                   Same issuer bonds    Intermediate bonds

<h2>Asset Location Strategy: Where to Hold What</h2>
<h3>The Tax-Efficiency Hierarchy</h3>
<p><strong>Stocks and Stock Funds</strong> (low income, tax-efficient)</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxed only on gains (when sold) and dividends (if qualified)</li>
<li>Best for: Tax-deferred accounts OR taxable if held long-term</li>
<li>Location: Roth IRA, 401(k), or Taxable accounts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonds and Bond Funds</strong> (high income, inefficient)</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxed as ordinary income every year on interest</li>
<li>Worst in taxable accounts</li>
<li>Best Location: Traditional IRA, 401(k), tax-deferred accounts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REITs</strong> (high income, taxed as ordinary income)</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly/quarterly distributions taxed as ordinary income</li>
<li>Disastrous in taxable accounts</li>
<li>Best location: IRA, 401(k), or tax-deferred</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dividend Stocks</strong> (moderate income, qualified divs get preference)</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualified dividends are tax-efficient</li>
<li>Can hold in taxable accounts (vs REITs/Bonds)</li>
<li>Best: Still better in tax-deferred accounts, but acceptable taxable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Growth Stocks</strong> (minimal income, capital appreciation)</p>
<ul>
<li>No annual tax drag if held long-term</li>
<li>Most tax-efficient in taxable accounts</li>
<li>Can hold in taxable and defer taxes decades</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation Example</h3>
<pre><code>
Total Portfolio: $500,000



Tax-Deferred Accounts (IRA, 401k): $250,000

- 50% Bonds: $125,000 (taxable interest is OK here)

- 30% REITs: $75,000 (high distributions OK here)

- 20% Dividend stocks: $50,000 (filler)



Taxable Account: $250,000

- 60% Growth stocks: $150,000 (buy and hold, minimal taxes)

- 25% Dividend stocks: $62,500 (qualified dividends preferred)

- 15% Municipal bonds: $37,500 (tax-free income!)



Result: Interest and REIT distributions in tax-deferred,

        Growth in taxable (minimal annual taxes)

</code></pre>
<h2>Holding Period Management</h2>
<h3>Timing Sales for Tax Efficiency</h3>
<p><strong>Strategy 1: Hold Until Qualified (1+ year)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bought: January 5, 2024

Sale Date Options:

- January 4, 2025: SHORT-TERM (one day too early!)

- January 5, 2025: LONG-TERM (exactly 1 year, tax-efficient)



Tax Difference:

If gain is $5,000:

- Short-term (24% rate): $1,200 tax

- Long-term (15% rate): $750 tax

- SAVINGS: $450 (just by waiting 1 day!)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Strategy 2: "Sell in December, Buy in January"</strong></p>
<pre><code>
December (Current Year):

1. Sell winners to harvest long-term gains

2. Realize losses from underwater positions

3. Net gains reduced or eliminated



January (New Year):

1. Reinvest in similar holdings

2. Start new 1-year holding period

3. Portfolio remains similar, taxes minimized

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Strategy 3: Stagger Sales Across Years</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Problem: Realized $30,000 in gains in one year

Solution: Spread sales across two years



Year 1: Sell winners with $15,000 in gains

        Harvest losses to offset

        Net tax: Minimal



Year 2: Sell remaining winners with $15,000 in gains

        Lower overall tax impact

</code></pre>
<h2>Tax-Advantaged Accounts Priority</h2>
<h3>Account Hierarchy for Deposits</h3>
<pre><code>
PRIORITY 1: Take full employer 401(k) match

            (Free money! Don&#39;t leave it)



PRIORITY 2: Max out HSA if available

            (Triple tax advantage)

            - Pre-tax contribution

            - Tax-free growth

            - Tax-free medical withdrawals



PRIORITY 3: Max out Roth IRA

            ($7,000/year, $8,000 if 50+)

            (Tax-free growth forever)



PRIORITY 4: Max out 401(k) or solo 401(k)

            ($23,500/year, more if self-employed)

            (Deductible, tax-free growth)



PRIORITY 5: Contribute to taxable account

            (Use after tax-advantaged maxed)

</code></pre>
<h3>Account Contribution Limits (2024)</h3>
<pre><code>
401(k):              $23,500 ($31,000 if 50+)

IRA (Roth/Trad):    $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)

HSA (Individual):   $4,150 ($5,150 if 55+)

Solo 401(k):        $69,000 (self-employed)

SEP IRA:            25% of net self-emp income

Mega Backdoor Roth: Up to $69,000/year

</code></pre>
<h2>Tax Reporting and Documentation</h2>
<h3>Required Records</h3>
<pre><code>
For each transaction:

- Purchase date

- Cost basis (price paid + commissions)

- Sale date

- Sale price

- Dividend dates and amounts

- Interest received

- 1099 forms from brokers

</code></pre>
<h3>Using Cost Basis Methods</h3>
<p><strong>First-In, First-Out (FIFO)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bought 100 shares at $50

Bought 100 shares at $60

Bought 100 shares at $70

Sell 100 shares



FIFO assumes: Sold the $50 shares

Result: Biggest gain! Higher taxes

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Specific Identification</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bought 100 shares at $50

Bought 100 shares at $60

Bought 100 shares at $70

Sell 100 shares: &quot;Specifically sell the $70 shares&quot;



Result: Smallest gain! Lower taxes

Cost: Must track and declare specific lots



Most brokers now allow this (select at sale)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Average Cost Basis</strong></p>
<pre><code>
300 shares worth ($50+$60+$70)/3 = $60 average



When selling 100 shares:

Cost basis: $60 × 100 = $6,000



Results: Middle ground between FIFO and specific ID

</code></pre>
<h3>Tax Form 8949 and Schedule D</h3>
<pre><code>
Form 8949: Reports each sale and capital gain/loss

Schedule D: Summary of gains/losses



Needed for:

- Stock/fund sales

- Option exercises

- Dividend income

- Interest income (if &gt;$1,500)

</code></pre>
<h2>Capital Loss Carryforward</h2>
<h3>Using Losses in Future Years</h3>
<pre><code>
Situation:

Year 1: Realized $8,000 in losses, $3,000 in gains

        Net loss: $5,000

        Can deduct: $3,000 against income

        Carryforward loss: $2,000



Year 2: Realized $1,000 in gains

        Use $1,000 of carryforward loss

        Net taxable gain: $0

        Remaining carryforward: $1,000



Year 3: No gains, $5,000 regular income

        Use $3,000 carryforward loss (annual limit)

        Remaining carryforward: -$2,000

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Rules:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
- Can deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income/year

- Excess carries forward indefinitely

- Use shortest holding period losses first (more valuable)

- Can offset unlimited capital gains

</code></pre>
