</code></pre>
<div class="example-block">
    <strong>Pyramiding (scaling up):</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Add to WINNING positions</li>
        <li>Each add is smaller than previous</li>
        <li>Lock in some profit, keep upside exposure</li>
        <li>Example: Buy 100 shares, add 50 on dip, add 25 on breakout</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Averaging (scaling in):</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Build position before price confirmation</li>
        <li>Add at predefined levels during setup</li>
        <li>Average cost down (but carefully!)</li>
        <li>Example: Buy 50 shares, buy 50 more on dip, buy 50 more on bounce</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Averaging down (dangerous):</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Add to LOSING positions</li>
        <li>Trying to lower average cost</li>
        <li>Often increases losses</li>
        <li>AVOID THIS - Causes ruin</li>
        <li>Example: Buy 100 at $100, drops to $90, buy 100 more at $90</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Different goals:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Pyramiding: Lock profit on winners, stay exposed</li>
        <li>Averaging: Build better cost basis before move</li>
        <li>Averaging down: Psychology (wrong thinking)</li>

<h2>Pyramiding Strategy</h2>
<h3>Concept: Scaling Up Winning Positions</h3>
<pre><code>
Position: Long MSFT at $350 (100 shares = $35,000)

Profit target: $380 (+8.6%)

Hold time: 5-10 days



Pyramid approach:

- Initial move: Price rallies to $360

- First pyramid: Add 50 shares (smaller than first 100)

- Move: Price rallies to $370

- Second pyramid: Add 25 shares (smaller than previous 50)

- Total position: 175 shares

- Average cost: Blended between $350, $360, $370



Calculation:

- Original: 100 × $350 = $35,000

- Pyramid 1: 50 × $360 = $18,000

- Pyramid 2: 25 × $370 = $9,250

- Total: 175 shares for $62,250

- Average cost: $62,250 / 175 = $355.71



Exit plan at $380:

- 175 shares × $380 = $66,500

- Profit: $66,500 - $62,250 = $4,250

- Return: 6.8% on capital deployed

- Would have been: 100 × ($380-$350) = $3,000 without pyramids

- Pyramid benefit: Additional $1,250 profit



Benefits:

- Profit from every stage of move

- Average cost lower than initial entry

- More shares working when price highest

- Each pyramid smaller = Reducing risk



Danger:

- If trend reverses at $370, extra shares lose money

- 175 shares × $10 stop hit = $1,750 loss vs. $1,000 on original

- Increased leverage increases drawdown

</code></pre>
<h3>Pyramid Strategy: Different Market Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Bullish market pyramiding:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Setup: Stock breaking out, strong momentum

Entry: $100 (50 shares = $5,000)

RSI: 62 (strong but not extreme)

MACD: Positive, histogram expanding

Plan: Buy more on strength, not weakness



Development:

Day 1: Entry $100, price $100.50 EOD

- Position: 50 shares

- Observation: Breakout holding



Day 2: Open $101.50, buy +25 shares

- Pyramid 1: 25 × $101.50 = $2,537.50

- Total: 75 shares, avg cost = $100.83

- Reason: Clear follow-through, momentum confirmed



Day 3: Open $103, buy +12 shares

- Pyramid 2: 12 × $103 = $1,236

- Total: 87 shares, avg cost = $100.96

- Reason: Continued strength but slowing adds



Day 4: Price $105, take profits

- Sell 29 shares at $105 (original 50 - 50% = 25, add pyramid 1)

- Profit: 29 × ($105 - $100.83) = $122

- Remaining: 58 shares (pyramids 2 + remaining original)



Outcome: Scaled in on strength, took profits, let remainder run



Key principle: Pyramid on STRENGTH (price rising)

- Adds happen on up days

- Each add gets smaller

- When trend stops, stop adding

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Corrective market pyramiding:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Setup: Pullback in established uptrend

Trend: Price above 50-day MA, higher lows

Entry: Buy after pullback

Plan: Scale in on dips and bounces



Development:

Entry 1: Price drops to $95 (5% pullback)

- Buy 40 shares at $95

- Reason: Support holding, buying dip



Entry 2: Price drops to $92 (7% pullback)

- Buy 30 shares at $92

- Total: 70 shares, avg cost = $93.57

- Reason: Strong support, lower adds



Entry 3: Price bounces to $95 (confirmation)

- Buy 20 shares at $95

- Total: 90 shares, avg cost = $93.89

- Reason: Support confirms, bounce confirms reversal



Exit: Price rallies to $110

- Sell all 90 shares at $110

- Profit: 90 × ($110 - $93.89) = $1,449.90 (15.4%)

- Benefit: Larger position on recovery trade



Key principle: Pyramid on SUPPORT (dips and bounces)

- Adds happen on down days in uptrend

- Build position as price recovers

- Each add smaller than previous

- Reduces average cost substantially

</code></pre>
<h3>Pyramid Position Sizing Rules</h3>
<pre><code>
Original position: 50 shares (100%)

Risk: 1.5% of account = $300



Pyramid 1: 25 shares (50% of original)

- Risk: 1.5% of account = $300

- Total risk so far: $600 (3% of account)



Pyramid 2: 12 shares (25% of original)

- Risk: 1.5% of account = $300

- Total risk so far: $900 (4.5% of account)



Pyramid 3: 6 shares (12% of original)

- Risk: $300

- Total risk so far: $1,200 (6% of account)



Pattern: Each pyramid is 50% of previous



Total position: 50 + 25 + 12 + 6 = 93 shares

Total capital invested: Depends on prices at each add

Total risk: $1,200 (6% of $20K account)



Control method:

- Each add is fixed risk ($300)

- Shares purchased = Risk / Stop distance

- Prevents over-leverage

- Maintains discipline



Stop loss management:

- Original stop: $340 for first 50

- Add pyramids only if stop still valid

- If one stop hit: Total loss limited

- Exit all if main trend reverses

</code></pre>
<h2>Averaging Strategy (Building Positions)</h2>
<h3>Concept: Strategic Entry Averaging</h3>
<pre><code>
Setup: High-conviction swing trade identified

Price action: Consolidation, waiting for breakout

Plan: Build position before move, not after



Entry plan:

Buy 1: At support ($100)

Buy 2: At mid-consolidation ($105)

Buy 3: On breakout ($110)



Execution:



Entry 1: Stock at support $99.50

- Buy 40 shares at $99.50 (cost: $3,980)

- Reason: Logical support, start building



Wait: Stock consolidates $100-$105, 3 days



Entry 2: Stock at $105 (mid-range)

- Buy 30 shares at $105 (cost: $3,150)

- Total: 70 shares at avg $101.86

- Reason: Confirming consolidation support



Wait: Stock continues consolidating



Entry 3: Stock breaks above $110 (breakout)

- Buy 20 shares at $110.50 (cost: $2,210)

- Total: 90 shares at avg $103.56

- Reason: Breakout confirmation, final add



Target: $125



Result at target:

- 90 shares × $125 = $11,250

- Cost basis: $9,340

- Profit: $1,910 (20.4% gain)

- Benefit: More shares working when confirmation comes



vs. Single entry:

- Buy 90 at $110 (breakout only)

- Cost: $9,900

- Profit at $125: $1,350

- Difference: Saved $560 by averaging earlier

</code></pre>
<h3>Averaging Rules (Safety First)</h3>
<pre><code>
DO:

✓ Average into UPTRENDS (price rising)

✓ Average at SUPPORT levels (technical confirmation)

✓ Average with DECLINING position size (smaller adds)

✓ Average with DECLINING risk per add ($300 max each)

✓ Average when THESIS unchanged (conviction high)

✓ Average with PROPER STOPS (protect each add)



DON&#39;T:

✗ Average into DOWNTRENDS (losing trades)

✗ Average below moving averages (breaking trend)

✗ Average with EQUAL position sizes (increases leverage)

✗ Average without stops (reckless)

✗ Average when THESIS BROKEN (revenge trading)

✗ Average after hitting stop loss (averaging down!)



Example: Correct averaging in uptrend

- Uptrend: $90 → $100 → $110

- Support: $105 (pullback to support in uptrend)

- Add: Buy more at $105 support

- Risk: Limited (support holding, trend intact)



Example: Incorrect averaging in downtrend

- Downtrend: $110 → $100 → $90

- &quot;Support&quot;: $95 (claimed support, but broken)

- Add: Buy more at $95 (averaging down!)

- Risk: UNLIMITED (trend broken, no support)

</code></pre>
<h2>What NOT to Do: Averaging Down</h2>
<h3>Dangerous Strategy: Averaging Down Into Losses</h3>
<pre><code>
The psychology:

- Buy AAPL at $100 (feels good)

- Price drops to $90 (feels bad)

- Think: &quot;If I buy at $90, my average is $95&quot; (feels better)

- Buy more shares at $90

- Price drops to $80 (feels terrible)

- Think: &quot;If I buy at $80, average is $83.33&quot; (feels better temporarily)

- Keep averaging down through $70, $60, $50



The math:

- 100 shares at $100 = $10,000

- 100 shares at $90 = $9,000 (total $19,000 = 200 shares)

- 100 shares at $80 = $8,000 (total $27,000 = 300 shares)

- Average cost: $27,000 / 300 = $90



The problem:

- Average cost looks better ($90 vs. $100)

- But position risk MULTIPLIED (300 shares vs. 100)

- Capital deployed TRIPLED ($27,000 vs. $10,000)

- If stock continues to $50: Loss = -$12,000 (63% of $19,000!)



Example of ruin:

- Original: 100 shares at $100, stop $80 = -$2,000 max loss

- Averaged down: 300 shares by $80, loss = -$9,000 (MUCH WORSE!)

- What was meant to be 2% loss became 47% loss!



The addiction:

- Lower average cost creates false hope

- Temporary relief from paper loss

- Each drop creates urge to average

- Eventually: Catastrophic loss that wipes account



The math trap:

- Psychologically: &quot;Average cost is better&quot;

- Financially: &quot;Total loss is MUCH worse&quot;

- Never average into losing position!

</code></pre>
<h3>Why Averaging Down Fails</h3>
<pre><code>
Reason 1: Thesis was wrong

- You were wrong on entry

- Stock keeps dropping

- Averaging down = Doubling down on wrong thesis

- Result: Catastrophic loss



Reason 2: Trend has reversed

- Stock was in uptrend at $100

- Now in downtrend, moving to $70

- Averaging assumes trend will reverse

- Trend rarely reverses at averaging points

- Result: False bottom, continue lower



Reason 3: Exponential loss acceleration

- Loss at $100: 0%

- Loss at $90: 10%

- Loss at $80: 20%

- Loss at $70: 30%

- Loss at $60: 40%

- Each level down = Larger % loss

- If you average at EACH level, position grows

- Total loss: -50% to -70% (RUIN!)



Reason 4: Capital exhaustion

- Can&#39;t average down forever

- Account capital limited

- Eventually no capital to average

- Forced to exit at WORST price

- Result: Largest loss possible



Rule: ACCEPT LOSSES

- Stop loss at $80 (2% loss)

- Exit there, move on

- Capital preserved for next trade

- Much better than averaging down to -50% loss

</code></pre>
<h2>Scaling Position Management</h2>
<h3>Managing Multiple Entries</h3>
<p><strong>Tracking different cost bases:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: 3-entry pyramid strategy

- Entry 1: 50 shares at $100 (first)

- Entry 2: 30 shares at $105 (add)

- Entry 3: 15 shares at $110 (final)



Total: 95 shares



Average cost calculation:

- (50 × $100) + (30 × $105) + (15 × $110) = $9,500 + $3,150 + $1,650 = $14,300

- Average: $14,300 / 95 = $150.53



Tracking in spreadsheet:

| Entry | Shares | Price | Cost   | Date |

|-------|--------|-------|--------|------|

| 1     | 50     | 100   | 5,000  | Jan1 |

| 2     | 30     | 105   | 3,150  | Jan3 |

| 3     | 15     | 110   | 1,650  | Jan5 |

| Total | 95     | 150.5 | 9,800  |      |



Exit plan:

- Option 1: Exit all at once at target

  - 95 × $120 = $11,400

  - Profit: $11,400 - $9,800 = $1,600



- Option 2: Exit in stages

  - Exit 1: 30 shares at $115 = $3,450 (profit: $900)

  - Exit 2: 35 shares at $120 = $4,200 (profit: $1,400)

  - Exit 3: 30 shares at $125 = $3,750 (profit: $2,250)

  - Total: Profit $4,550 (split across exits)

</code></pre>
<h3>Stop Loss Management for Scaled Positions</h3>
<pre><code>
3-entry position with different stops:



Entry 1 (50 shares @ $100):

- Stop loss: $95 (original $500 stop)



Entry 2 (30 shares @ $105):

- Stop loss: $98 (new entry support)



Entry 3 (15 shares @ $110):

- Stop loss: $105 (breakout support)



Position stop:

- How to set stops for 95 share total?

- Option 1: Multiple orders

  - 50 share stop at $95

  - 30 share stop at $98

  - 15 share stop at $105

  - Confusing, creates slippage



- Option 2: Single unified stop

  - Use average cost: $150.53 (wait, that&#39;s wrong number)

  - Use lowest support from any entry: $95

  - Stop all 95 shares at $95

  - Single order, clean execution



Better approach:

- If price breaks support, entire position fails thesis

- Exit all at once at lowest confirmed support

- Don&#39;t try to manage multiple exits on same position

- Simpler, cleaner, less emotional

</code></pre>
<h2>Real Scaling Example: Multi-Day Build</h2>
<h3>Case Study: Building MSFT Position Over 1 Week</h3>
<pre><code>
Setup: MSFT showing consolidation pattern

- Support: $330

- Resistance: $345

- Range: 4.5% (good setup)

- Plan: Build 3-entry position over week



Entry 1 (Monday):

- Market: $335 (neutral)

- Decision: Buy half position at support

- Buy: 35 shares at $334.50

- Cost: $11,707.50

- Plan: Build from here



Entry 2 (Wednesday):

- Market: $331 (pullback)

- Support confirmed: Hold at $331

- Decision: Add to position

- Buy: 25 shares at $331.00

- Total: 60 shares, avg $332.92

- Cost: $19,975



Entry 3 (Friday):

- Market: $340 (bouncing)

- Breakout: Above $340 resistance

- Decision: Final add on breakout

- Buy: 15 shares at $340.50

- Total: 75 shares, avg $334.78

- Cost: $25,108.50



Target: $355 (+5.9%)



Monday next week (Exit):

- Price reaches $355

- Sell all 75 shares at $355

- Proceeds: $26,625

- Profit: $26,625 - $25,108.50 = $1,516.50

- Return: 6.0% on capital



Comparison:

- Single entry at $340 (Friday only): 75 × ($355-$340) = $1,125 profit

- Pyramid strategy: $1,516.50 profit

- Benefit: $391.50 additional profit (35% more!)



Key learning:

- Averaged price down to $334.78 (vs. $340 single entry)

- Better cost basis = Better profit when exiting

- Built position on strength and weakness

- Multiple entries = Lower risk per entry

- Result: Higher profit on same target price
