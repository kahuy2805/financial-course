<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Earnings reports are the most important events for fundamental investors and traders. When companies release quarterly earnings, stock prices can swing 10-20% in hours. Understanding what to look for in earnings reports will help you make smarter decisions and avoid the worst surprises.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 25-30 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completion of Lesson 7.3: Financial Ratios</li>
<li>Understanding of income statement basics</li>
<li>Familiarity with year-over-year growth concepts</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>Why Earnings Matter</h3>
<p><strong>Earnings Report</strong> is when a company announces its quarterly financial results to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Crucial:</strong></p>
<p>Stock prices are based on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current profit</strong> (what the company makes now)</li>
<li><strong>Expected future profit</strong> (what investors think it will make)</li>
</ol>
<p>Earnings reports update both of these, causing massive price swings.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Earnings Surprises</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Situation: Apple announces earnings



Expected Earnings Per Share: $1.50

Actual Earnings Per Share: $1.60

Beat by: 6.7%



Result: Stock rallies 8% same day

Why? Profit is better than expected, future looks better



Opposite scenario:

Expected EPS: $1.50

Actual EPS: $1.40

Miss by: 6.7%



Result: Stock drops 12% same day

Why? Profit is worse than expected, future looks worse

</code></pre>
<h3>The Earnings Report Components</h3>
<p>#### 1. EPS (Earnings Per Share)</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Net profit divided by number of shares outstanding.</p>
<pre><code>
Net Income: $50B

Shares Outstanding: 16B

EPS = $50B ÷ 16B = $3.125

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Company can be profitable but share count can inflate/deflate</li>
<li>Buybacks reduce shares (same profit, higher EPS)</li>
<li>Share dilution increases shares (same profit, lower EPS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple vs. Microsoft Share Counts</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Apple:

- Net Income: $99B

- Shares: 15B

- EPS: $6.60



Microsoft:

- Net Income: $72B

- Shares: 8.4B

- EPS: $8.57



Same profit, different EPS because of different share counts

Apple doing more buybacks, reducing share count

</code></pre>
<p>#### 2. Revenue (Top Line)</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Total sales before any expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is revenue growing? (Should be 5-15% year-over-year)</li>
<li>Is growth accelerating or slowing?</li>
<li>Is growth driven by price increases or volume increases?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Good vs. Bad Revenue</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Company A:

- Year 1 Revenue: $100M

- Year 2 Revenue: $115M (+15% growth)

- Year 2 Gross Margin: 45% (same as Year 1)

Signal: HEALTHY GROWTH



Company B:

- Year 1 Revenue: $100M

- Year 2 Revenue: $110M (+10% growth)

- Year 2 Gross Margin: 40% (down from 45%)

Signal: WEAK GROWTH and margin compression



Company A better even though lower revenue growth

</code></pre>
<p>#### 3. Guidance (Forward Guidance)</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Company's projection for next quarter or next year's earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Critical:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock responds to EXPECTATIONS</li>
<li>If company guides higher than consensus, stock rallies</li>
<li>If company guides lower than consensus, stock crashes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Guidance Miss</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Situation: Microsoft earnings



Reported Numbers: BEAT

- Q3 EPS: $2.75 vs expected $2.60

- Revenue: $52B vs expected $51B

- Both beat, stock should go up!



But company guidance for Q4:

- Expected: $3.00 EPS

- Guidance: $2.90 EPS (3.3% miss!)



Result: Stock drops 5% despite beating current quarter

Why? Market cares more about FUTURE than past

Future guidance missed, so future profits might be lower

</code></pre>
<p>#### 4. Operating Margin</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Operating profit divided by revenue (profit before interest and taxes).</p>
<pre><code>
Operating Profit: $50M

Revenue: $200M

Operating Margin: 25%

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shows if company is getting more efficient</li>
<li>Expanding margin = improving profitability</li>
<li>Contracting margin = struggles with costs</li>
</ul>
<p>#### 5. Free Cash Flow</p>
<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More important than profit (real cash)</li>
<li>Shows if profit is sustainable</li>
<li>Available for dividends, buybacks, debt paydown</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Four Types of Earnings Beats/Misses</h3>
<p>#### Beat on EPS, Beat on Revenue</p>
<pre><code>
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.60 ✓

Expected Revenue: $100M, Actual: $110M ✓



Result: VERY BULLISH

Stock usually rallies 5-15%

</code></pre>
<p>#### Beat on EPS, Miss on Revenue</p>
<pre><code>
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.60 ✓

Expected Revenue: $110M, Actual: $105M ✗



Result: MIXED (Usually negative)

Company cut costs to hit EPS, but sales disappointed

Stock usually drops 3-8%

</code></pre>
<p>#### Miss on EPS, Beat on Revenue</p>
<pre><code>
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.45 ✗

Expected Revenue: $100M, Actual: $115M ✓



Result: MIXED (Usually positive if growth is strong)

Revenue is strong, but margins compressed

Stock reaction depends on margin outlook

</code></pre>
<p>#### Miss on EPS, Miss on Revenue</p>
<pre><code>
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.30 ✗

Expected Revenue: $110M, Actual: $100M ✗



Result: VERY BEARISH

Stock usually drops 10-20%

</code></pre>
<h3>Key Metrics to Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Year-over-Year Growth (YoY)</strong></p>
<p>Compare current quarter to same quarter last year:</p>
<pre><code>
Q1 2024 Revenue: $50B

Q1 2023 Revenue: $45B

YoY Growth: (50-45)/45 = 11.1%



This is much better indicator than sequential (quarter to quarter)

Because of seasonality effects

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Forward P/E vs. Trailing P/E</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Trailing P/E: Uses actual past earnings

- Stock Price $100, Past 12 months EPS $5

- Trailing P/E: 20



Forward P/E: Uses estimated future earnings

- Stock Price $100, Next 12 months estimated EPS $5.50

- Forward P/E: 18.2



Forward P/E lower means market expecting earnings growth

This is positive sign if guidance supports it

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Guidance Quality</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Conservative Guidance:

- Company estimates low growth

- Usually beats, stock rallies

- Happens when management is confident



Aggressive Guidance:

- Company estimates high growth

- Usually meets or barely beats

- Risky if they miss, stock crashes

</code></pre>
<h3>Reading an Earnings Report</h3>
<p><strong>Structure of Earnings Release:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Top line results</strong> (EPS and Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Key metrics</strong> (margins, growth, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Segment breakdown</strong> (results by business line)</li>
<li><strong>Forward guidance</strong> (next quarter/year expectations)</li>
<li><strong>Management discussion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Red Flags to Watch:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
⚠️ &quot;One-time charges&quot; or &quot;restructuring costs&quot;

→ One-time charges can distort results



⚠️ &quot;In line with guidance&quot; but actual beat is small

→ Conservative guidance, expectations low



⚠️ Revenue beat but margin miss

→ Growing top-line but profit shrinking (bad)



⚠️ Guidance lowered from previous guidance

→ Company just lowered expectations, more pain ahead



⚠️ High executive turnover mentioned

→ Leadership instability, uncertainty



⚠️ &quot;Challenging macro environment&quot;

→ Blaming external factors instead of taking responsibility

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Green Flags to Watch:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
✓ Revenue AND earnings both beat

→ Strong execution, execution risk low



✓ Margin expansion

→ Getting more efficient, pricing power



✓ Guidance raised

→ Management confidence increasing



✓ Free cash flow acceleration

→ Profitability improving in real cash terms



✓ Share buybacks announced

→ Management thinks stock is undervalued

</code></pre>
<h3>The Earnings Calendar</h3>
<p><strong>Timing of Earnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q1 Earnings:</strong> April-May</li>
<li><strong>Q2 Earnings:</strong> July-August</li>
<li><strong>Q3 Earnings:</strong> October-November</li>
<li><strong>Q4 Earnings:</strong> January-February</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Dates Around Earnings:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Day 0: Earnings released (usually after market close)

Day 0-2: Stock reacts massively (10%+ moves common)

Day 5-7: Analyst updates and revisions

Week 2-3: Most of the shock is absorbed

Month 1-2: Stock settles into new valuation



Best trading opportunities:

- Day 0-1: Biggest reaction if you trade immediately

- Day 5-7: After initial shock, as revisions come in

- Avoid: Day 2-3, still volatile and emotional

</code></pre>
<h3>The Earnings Surprise Effect</h3>
<p><strong>Why Stocks React Before Earnings:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Option A: Company beats on EPS but guides lower

- Stock was down 5% already (market sensed weak guidance)

- Earnings beat doesn&#39;t matter because future is weak



Option B: Company beats on EPS, guidance is strong

- Stock rallies even more (both now and future are good)



Lesson: Stock price anticipates earnings surprises

Market is forward-looking

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Netflix Earnings Reactions</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Scenario 1: Strong Earnings, Raised Guidance

- Revenue Beat: Yes (+20% YoY)

- Subscriber Growth: Beat expectations by 100k

- Guidance: Raised full-year outlook

- Result: Stock rallies 15% next day



Scenario 2: Weak Earnings, Maintained Guidance

- Revenue Miss: -2% YoY

- Subscriber Growth: Miss expectations by 200k

- Guidance: Maintained (same as before)

- Result: Stock drops 10% next day



Market cares about trajectory

Beat with weak guidance worse than miss with strong guidance

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Trading the Day Before Earnings</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Hoping for a beat, you buy day before. Stock crashes on miss.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Either trade the morning after (confirmed direction) or avoid earnings week entirely.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Focusing Only on EPS Beat</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> EPS beat, but company cut guidance. You think it's bullish.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always check guidance. Guidance is more important than current beat.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Ignoring the Margin Story</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Revenue beats, stock rallies. You don't notice margins compressed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compare margins to past quarters. Expanding margins better than margin compression.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Missing Cash Flow Story</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Profit looks good, but free cash flow is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always check free cash flow. Profit can be fiction, cash is real.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Not Checking Year-over-Year Comparison</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Revenue up 20% quarter-to-quarter, you think it's great. But it's just seasonal.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always compare to same quarter last year (YoY), not last quarter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Pre-Earnings Research Checklist</h3>
<p>Before earnings announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] What are consensus estimates? (Revenue and EPS)</li>
<li>[ ] What's the historical beat/miss rate? (Does company usually beat or miss?)</li>
<li>[ ] What were margins last quarter? (Expecting expansion or compression?)</li>
<li>[ ] What was free cash flow last quarter?</li>
<li>[ ] What guidance was given last quarter?</li>
<li>[ ] Are there any one-time items expected?</li>
<li>[ ] Which key metric matters most? (Subscribers for Netflix, iPhone sales for Apple?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post-Earnings Reaction Plan</h3>
<pre><code>
IF Beat + Raise Guidance:

→ VERY BULLISH, most likely up 5-15%

→ Next support = 50-day MA or Fib 38.2%



IF Beat + Maintain Guidance:

→ NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY BULLISH, usually up 2-5%

→ Less upside potential



IF Miss + Cut Guidance:

→ VERY BEARISH, most likely down 5-20%

→ Next support = 200-day MA or Fib 61.8%



IF Miss + Maintain Guidance:

→ NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY BEARISH, usually down 2-5%

→ Watch for reversal

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>✓ <strong>EPS</strong> = Earnings per share, most watched metric</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Revenue</strong> = Top line, should grow 5-15% YoY</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Margins</strong> = Operating and gross margin trends matter</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Guidance</strong> = Future expectations, sometimes more important than current beat</p>
<p>✓ <strong>FCF</strong> = Free cash flow, real money the company generates</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Beat vs. Miss</strong> = Context matters (good guidance better than bad)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Timing</strong> = Stock moves before and after, don't assume direction</p>
