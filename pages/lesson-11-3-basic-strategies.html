                <h1>Lesson 11.3: Basic Options Strategies</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Now that you understand calls, puts, and options terminology, let's explore practical strategies professional traders use. This lesson covers two fundamental strategies used by millions of traders: covered calls and protective puts.</p>
<p>These strategies form the foundation for more complex multi-leg strategies you'll learn later.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Strategy 1: Covered Call (Call Covered by Stock)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A <strong>covered call</strong> is a strategy where you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Own</strong> 100 shares of stock</li>
<li><strong>Sell</strong> one call option against those shares</li>
<li>Keep the premium income while capping upside</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses Covered Calls?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dividend investors wanting extra income</li>
<li>Traders with stock that's near a resistance level</li>
<li>Investors neutral to slightly bullish on a stock</li>
<li>Anyone wanting to "get paid" on their holdings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<pre><code>
Setup:

- Buy 100 shares at $100 (current market price)

- Simultaneously sell 1 call with $105 strike for $2 premium

- Net cost: $100 - $0.02 (per share premium received) = $99.98



The &quot;covered&quot; part:

- If called away (stock assigned), you have the shares to deliver

- This is why it&#39;s &quot;covered&quot; - you own the underlying security

- Contrast with &quot;naked&quot; call where you don&#39;t own the shares (risky!)

</code></pre>
<h3>Risk Profile</h3>
<pre><code>
Maximum Profit:

- Stock rises to $105 or higher

- Called away at $105 strike price

- Profit = ($105 - $100) + $2 premium = $7 per share = $700 total

- Return on investment = $700/$10,000 = 7% return



Maximum Loss:

- Stock falls to $0 (and premium doesn&#39;t help much)

- You own shares worth $0, but keep $200 premium

- Loss = -$10,000 + $200 = -$9,800

- This is the loss from owning stock, reduced by premium



Breakeven:

- $100 - $0.02 = $99.98 per share

- The premium reduces your loss if stock drops



Scenario Analysis - AAPL at $180, sell $185 call for $2.50:

</code></pre>
<h3>Real Example: Covered Call Details</h3>
<pre><code>
Position Details:

- Buy 100 AAPL shares at $180

- Sell 1 AAPL $185 call for $2.50 ($250 total)

- Net debit: $18,000 - $250 = $17,750

- Days to expiration: 30



Scenario 1: AAPL at $200 on expiration (stock jumps 11%)

- Called away at $185 strike

- Gain on stock: ($185 - $180) × 100 = $500

- Plus premium: $250

- Total profit: $750 (4.2% return in 30 days)

- Annualized return: ~51%

- However, you miss the additional $1,500 gain from $185 to $200



Scenario 2: AAPL at $185 exactly (at the money)

- Called away at $185 strike

- Gain on stock: ($185 - $180) × 100 = $500

- Plus premium: $250

- Total profit: $750 (4.2% return in 30 days)

- Stock doesn&#39;t rise past strike



Scenario 3: AAPL at $175 on expiration (stock drops 2.8%)

- Option expires worthless (not called away)

- Loss on stock: ($175 - $180) × 100 = -$500

- Plus premium: $250 (you keep it)

- Net loss: -$250 (-1.4% loss in 30 days)

- Premium cushions your downside by 1.4%



Scenario 4: AAPL at $170 on expiration (larger drop)

- Option expires worthless

- Loss on stock: ($170 - $180) × 100 = -$1,000

- Plus premium: $250 (cushion)

- Net loss: -$750 (-4.2% loss)

- Premium helped but didn&#39;t prevent losses

<h3>When to Use Covered Calls</h3>
<p><strong>Good Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock at resistance level</li>
<li>You're neutral to slightly bullish</li>
<li>You've achieved significant gains and want to lock in profit</li>
<li>You own dividend stocks and want extra income</li>
<li>IV is high (premium is expensive, good for sellers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock is breaking out to the upside (don't cap gains)</li>
<li>IV is very low (not worth the risk)</li>
<li>You're very bullish and expect big gains</li>
<li>You need full downside protection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
<pre><code>
Mistake 1: Not being assigned

&quot;I sold the call but stock stayed below strike&quot;

- You keep the premium AND the stock

- This is actually the desired outcome for income



Mistake 2: Margin call on assignment

- When assigned, you deliver 100 shares

- Need to plan for this: have shares ready or buy-to-close the call first

- If margin: holding the short call requires margin until assigned



Mistake 3: Selling calls too close to dividends

- Assignment pulled you through dividend

- You miss the dividend but already in loss

- Check ex-dividend dates before selling calls



Mistake 4: Chasing returns with deep OTM calls

- Selling $200 call when stock at $180 = low premium, low risk

- Selling $170 call when stock at $180 = high premium, high risk (likely assigned)

- Balance premium income with assignment risk

<h2>Strategy 2: Protective Put (Insurance on Your Stock)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A <strong>protective put</strong> is a strategy where you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Own</strong> 100 shares of stock</li>
<li><strong>Buy</strong> one put option as insurance</li>
<li>Limit downside losses while keeping upside potential</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the insurance strategy—you pay a premium to protect your gains.</p>
<h3>Who Uses Protective Puts?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio managers protecting stock positions during uncertainty</li>
<li>Traders holding through earnings</li>
<li>Investors after large gains wanting to lock in value</li>
<li>Anyone wanting "portfolio insurance"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<pre><code>
Setup:

- Own 100 shares at $100 (current market price)

- Buy 1 put with $95 strike for $2 premium

- Total cost: $100 per share + $2 premium = $102 per share



Protection:

- If stock falls below $95, you can sell at $95

- You&#39;re insured against drops greater than 5%

- This is literally insurance: you paid a premium for protection

</code></pre>
<h3>Risk Profile</h3>
<pre><code>
Maximum Loss:

- Stock falls to $0

- You exercise put: sell shares at $95 strike

- Loss = $95 - $100 cost - $2 premium paid = -$7 per share

- Loss capped at $700 on 100 shares



Maximum Profit:

- Stock rises indefinitely

- Put expires worthless (not needed)

- Profit = Stock Price - $100 cost - $2 premium paid

- No cap on upside (unlimited profit potential)



Breakeven:

- $100 + $2 premium = $102 per share

- Stock needs to rise $2 to break even



Cost of Insurance:

- You paid $200 premium to protect $10,000 position

- That&#39;s 2% cost for 5% protection (not a bad deal)



Scenario Analysis - AAPL at $180, buy $175 put for $2:

</code></pre>
<h3>Real Example: Protective Put Details</h3>
<pre><code>
Position Details:

- Own 100 AAPL shares at $180

- Buy 1 AAPL $175 put for $2.00 ($200 total)

- Total investment: $18,000 + $200 = $18,200

- Days to expiration: 30 days

- Insurance period: 30 days



Scenario 1: AAPL at $200 on expiration (stock jumps 11%)

- Put expires worthless (not needed)

- Gain on stock: ($200 - $180) × 100 = $2,000

- Minus put premium paid: -$200

- Net profit: $1,800 (9.9% return in 30 days)

- The protection cost you $200 but wasn&#39;t needed



Scenario 2: AAPL at $175 on expiration (down to put strike)

- Put expires at-the-money

- Gain on stock: ($175 - $180) × 100 = -$500

- Plus put protection: $5 × 100 = $500 (can exercise)

- Minus put premium: -$200

- Net: -$200 (broke even on stock, lost insurance premium)

- Insurance cost you $200



Scenario 3: AAPL at $160 on expiration (down 11%)

- Put is in-the-money: exercise to sell at $175

- Loss on stock from purchase price: ($160 - $180) × 100 = -$2,000

- Put protection: sell at $175 instead of $160, gaining $1,500

- Net loss on stock movement: -$500

- Minus put premium: -$200

- Total loss: -$700 (-3.8% loss)

- Without put, you&#39;d have lost $2,000 (11%)



Scenario 4: AAPL at $100 on expiration (crash 44%)

- Put protection stops at $175

- Stock crashed to $100

- Put lets you sell at $175: saves you $7,500

- Loss prevented: $100 × 100 = $10,000 losses → $500 loss

- Net after premium: -$700 (-3.8%)

- Without put, you&#39;d have lost $8,000 (-44.4%)

- Put insurance paid for itself many times over

<h3>When to Use Protective Puts</h3>
<p><strong>Good Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock after large gains (wanting to preserve profits)</li>
<li>Before earnings (protecting from gap risk)</li>
<li>During market uncertainty (VIX spiking, geopolitical events)</li>
<li>If stock is at support and could break down</li>
<li>IV is moderate (not too expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock is in clear downtrend (puts won't help much)</li>
<li>IV is extremely high (expensive insurance)</li>
<li>Stock at all-time lows (unlikely to fall further)</li>
<li>Very short term outlook (time decay hurts buyers)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
<pre><code>
Mistake 1: Buying puts that are too OTM

&quot;I bought the $150 put while stock at $180&quot;

- Very cheap protection ($0.10)

- But only protects against 16.7% drop, not useful

- Buy puts at strikes you actually want to sell at



Mistake 2: Not rolling put protection

&quot;My 30-day put is expiring&quot;

- Insurance expired; buy new put or go uninsured

- Rolling costs money but preserves protection

- Calculate if protection is still needed



Mistake 3: Holding puts through earnings (if very close)

- Puts bought at high IV

- IV crush after earnings can hurt put buyers

- Consider taking profits before earnings if IV high



Mistake 4: Buying puts on positions you doubt

&quot;If I need insurance, why own the stock?&quot;

- Protective puts are for quality stocks you believe in

- Don&#39;t use puts to &quot;hedge&quot; a bad stock

- Sell the stock instead if you lack conviction

<h2>Comparison: Covered Call vs. Protective Put</h2>
<p>| Aspect | Covered Call | Protective Put |</p>
<p>|--------|--------------|-----------------|</p>
<p>| <strong>You Own Stock</strong> | Yes | Yes |</p>
<p>| <strong>You Also Buy/Sell</strong> | SELL call | BUY put |</p>
<p>| <strong>Cost</strong> | Receive premium | Pay premium |</p>
<p>| <strong>Upside Capped</strong> | Yes (at strike) | No (unlimited) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Downside Protected</strong> | Partially (by premium) | Yes (fully below strike) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Max Profit</strong> | Premium + (Strike - Cost) | Unlimited |</p>
<p>| <strong>Max Loss</strong> | Stock value - Strike - (Premium) | Strike - Cost - Premium |</p>
<p>| <strong>Sentiment</strong> | Neutral to bullish | Bullish but cautious |</p>
<p>| <strong>Best Used For</strong> | Income generation | Risk management |</p>
<p>| <strong>When Stock Soars</strong> | Lose upside | Keep all gains minus premium |</p>
<p>| <strong>When Stock Crashes</strong> | Lose money (cushioned) | Protected at strike |</p>
<hr>
<h2>Advanced Example: Synthetic Covered Call</h2>
<p>A sophisticated trader can create a covered call without owning stock.</p>
<pre><code>
Synthetic Covered Call = Long 100 shares + Short 1 call

Alternative = Long call + Short 2 calls (ratio)



Example with derivatives only:

- Buy 1 AAPL $175 call for $6

- Sell 2 AAPL $185 calls for $2 each = $4 income

- Net cost: $6 - $4 = $2 debit

- Risk profile similar to owning stock and selling call

- No stock ownership required

- More capital efficient



This is more advanced, but shows how strategies combine

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Covered Call</strong>: Sell income from stock you already own; cap upside to collect premium</li>
<li><strong>Protective Put</strong>: Buy insurance on stock you own; pay premium for downside protection</li>
<li><strong>Covered Call</strong> = income generation (bearish on further upside)</li>
<li><strong>Protective Put</strong> = risk management (cautiously bullish)</li>
<li><strong>Both strategies</strong> involve owning the underlying stock</li>
<li><strong>Neither strategy</strong> is free; tradeoffs exist in every scenario</li>
</ol>

<h2>In the Next Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lesson 11.4 introduces the Greeks—the variables that drive option prices</li>
<li>Understanding Greeks helps you optimize both covered calls and protective puts</li>
<li>Greeks also form the foundation for more complex strategies</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Self-Assessment Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>You own AAPL at $180. You sell the $190 call for $2. If AAPL rises to $200, what's your profit?</li>
<li>You own TSLA at $250. You buy the $240 put for $3. If TSLA falls to $200, what's your outcome?</li>
<li>Why might an investor prefer a protective put over just selling the stock?</li>
<li>When would a covered call strategy cost you upside profits?</li>
<li>If you sold a covered call and the stock was called away, what happens next?</li>
</ol>
