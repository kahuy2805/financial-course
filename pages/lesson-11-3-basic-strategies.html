                <h1>Lesson 11.3: Basic Options Strategies</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Now that you understand calls, puts, and options terminology, let's explore practical strategies professional traders use. This lesson covers two fundamental strategies used by millions of traders: covered calls and protective puts.</p>
<p>These strategies form the foundation for more complex multi-leg strategies you'll learn later.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Strategy 1: Covered Call (Call Covered by Stock)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A <strong>covered call</strong> is a strategy where you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Own</strong> 100 shares of stock</li>
<li><strong>Sell</strong> one call option against those shares</li>
<li>Keep the premium income while capping upside</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses Covered Calls?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dividend investors wanting extra income</li>
<li>Traders with stock that's near a resistance level</li>
<li>Investors neutral to slightly bullish on a stock</li>
<li>Anyone wanting to "get paid" on their holdings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Setup:</strong><br>
  - Buy 100 shares at $100 (current market price)<br>
  - Simultaneously sell 1 call with $105 strike for $2 premium<br>
  - Net cost: $100 - $0.02 (per share premium received) = $99.98<br><br>
  <strong>The "covered" part:</strong><br>
  - If called away (stock assigned), you have the shares to deliver<br>
  - This is why it&#39;s "covered" - you own the underlying security<br>
  - Contrast with "naked" call where you don&#39;t own the shares (risky!)
</div>
<h3>Risk Profile</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Maximum Profit:</strong><br>
  - Stock rises to $105 or higher<br>
  - Called away at $105 strike price<br>
  - Profit = ($105 - $100) + $2 premium = $7 per share = $700 total<br>
  - Return on investment = $700/$10,000 = 7% return<br><br>
  <strong>Maximum Loss:</strong><br>
  - Stock falls to $0 (and premium doesn&#39;t help much)<br>
  - You own shares worth $0, but keep $200 premium<br>
  - Loss = -$10,000 + $200 = -$9,800<br>
  - This is the loss from owning stock, reduced by premium
</div>
<h3>When to Use Covered Calls</h3>
<p><strong>Good Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock at resistance level</li>
<li>You're neutral to slightly bullish</li>
<li>You've achieved significant gains and want to lock in profit</li>
<li>You own dividend stocks and want extra income</li>
<li>IV is high (premium is expensive, good for sellers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock is breaking out to the upside (don't cap gains)</li>
<li>IV is very low (not worth the risk)</li>
<li>You're very bullish and expect big gains</li>
<li>You need full downside protection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Mistake 1:</strong> This is actually the desired outcome for income<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 2: Margin call on assignment</strong><br>
  - When assigned, you deliver 100 shares<br>
  - Need to plan for this: have shares ready or buy-to-close the call first<br>
  - If margin: holding the short call requires margin until assigned<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 3: Selling calls too close to dividends</strong><br>
  - Assignment pulled you through dividend<br>
  - You miss the dividend but already in loss<br>
  - Check ex-dividend dates before selling calls<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 4: Chasing returns with deep OTM calls</strong><br>
  - Selling $200 call when stock at $180 = low premium, low risk<br>
  - Selling $170 call when stock at $180 = high premium, high risk (likely assigned)<br>
  - Balance premium income with assignment risk
</div>

<h2>Strategy 2: Protective Put (Insurance on Your Stock)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A <strong>protective put</strong> is a strategy where you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Own</strong> 100 shares of stock</li>
<li><strong>Buy</strong> one put option as insurance</li>
<li>Limit downside losses while keeping upside potential</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the insurance strategy—you pay a premium to protect your gains.</p>
<h3>Who Uses Protective Puts?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio managers protecting stock positions during uncertainty</li>
<li>Traders holding through earnings</li>
<li>Investors after large gains wanting to lock in value</li>
<li>Anyone wanting "portfolio insurance"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Setup:</strong><br>
  - Own 100 shares at $100 (current market price)<br>
  - Buy 1 put with $95 strike for $2 premium<br>
  - Total cost: $100 per share + $2 premium = $102 per share
</div>
<h3>Risk Profile</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Maximum Loss:</strong><br>
  - Stock falls to $0<br>
  - You exercise put: sell shares at $95 strike<br>
  - Loss = $95 - $100 cost - $2 premium paid = -$7 per share<br>
  - Loss capped at $700 on 100 shares<br>
  <strong>Maximum Profit:</strong><br>
  - Stock rises indefinitely<br>
  - Put expires worthless (not needed)<br>
  - Profit = Stock Price - $100 cost - $2 premium paid<br>
  - No cap on upside (unlimited profit potential)<br>
  <strong>Breakeven:</strong><br>
  - $100 + $2 premium = $102 per share<br>
  - Stock needs to rise $2 to break even<br>
  <strong>Cost of Insurance:</strong><br>
  - You paid $200 premium to protect $10,000 position<br>
  - That&#39;s 2% cost for 5% protection (not a bad deal)<br>
  <strong>Scenario Analysis - AAPL at $180, buy $175 put for $2:</strong>
</div>
<h3>Real Example: Protective Put Details</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Position Details:</strong><br>
  - Own 100 AAPL shares at $180<br>
  - Buy 1 AAPL $175 put for $2.00 ($200 total)<br>
  - Total investment: $18,000 + $200 = $18,200<br>
  - Days to expiration: 30 days<br>
  - Insurance period: 30 days<br><br>
  <strong>Scenario 1: AAPL at $200 on expiration (stock jumps 11%)</strong><br>
  - Put expires worthless (not needed)<br>
  - Gain on stock: ($200 - $180) × 100 = $2,000<br>
  - Minus put premium paid: -$200<br>
  - Net profit: $1,800 (9.9% return in 30 days)<br>
  - The protection cost you $200 but wasn&#39;t needed<br><br>
  <strong>Scenario 2: AAPL at $175 on expiration (down to put strike)</strong><br>
  - Put expires at-the-money<br>
  - Gain on stock: ($175 - $180) × 100 = -$500<br>
  - Plus put protection: $5 × 100 = $500 (can exercise)<br>
  - Minus put premium: -$200<br>
  - Net: -$200 (broke even on stock, lost insurance premium)<br>
  - Insurance cost you $200<br><br>
  <strong>Scenario 3: AAPL at $160 on expiration (down 11%)</strong><br>
  - Put is in-the-money: exercise to sell at $175<br>
  - Loss on stock from purchase price: ($160 - $180) × 100 = -$2,000<br>
  - Put protection: sell at $175 instead of $160, gaining $1,500<br>
  - Net loss on stock movement: -$500<br>
  - Minus put premium: -$200<br>
  - Total loss: -$700 (-3.8% loss)<br>
  - Without put, you&#39;d have lost $2,000 (11%)<br><br>
  <strong>Scenario 4: AAPL at $100 on expiration (crash 44%)</strong><br>
  - Put protection stops at $175<br>
  - Stock crashed to $100<br>
  - Put lets you sell at $175: saves you $7,500<br>
  - Loss prevented: $100 × 100 = $10,000 losses → $500 loss<br>
  - Net after premium: -$700 (-3.8%)<br>
  - Without put, you&#39;d have lost $8,000 (-44.4%)<br>
  - Put insurance paid for itself many times over
</div>
<h3>When to Use Protective Puts</h3>
<p><strong>Good Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock after large gains (wanting to preserve profits)</li>
<li>Before earnings (protecting from gap risk)</li>
<li>During market uncertainty (VIX spiking, geopolitical events)</li>
<li>If stock is at support and could break down</li>
<li>IV is moderate (not too expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock is in clear downtrend (puts won't help much)</li>
<li>IV is extremely high (expensive insurance)</li>
<li>Stock at all-time lows (unlikely to fall further)</li>
<li>Very short term outlook (time decay hurts buyers)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Mistake 1: Buying puts that are too OTM</strong><br>
  &quot;I bought the $150 put while stock at $180&quot;<br>
  - Very cheap protection ($0.10)<br>
  - But only protects against 16.7% drop, not useful<br>
  - Buy puts at strikes you actually want to sell at<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 2: Not rolling put protection</strong><br>
  &quot;My 30-day put is expiring&quot;<br>
  - Insurance expired; buy new put or go uninsured<br>
  - Rolling costs money but preserves protection<br>
  - Calculate if protection is still needed<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 3: Holding puts through earnings (if very close)</strong><br>
  - Puts bought at high IV<br>
  - IV crush after earnings can hurt put buyers<br>
  - Consider taking profits before earnings if IV high<br><br>
  <strong>Mistake 4: Buying puts on positions you doubt</strong><br>
  &quot;If I need insurance, why own the stock?&quot;<br>
  - Protective puts are for quality stocks you believe in<br>
  - Don&#39;t use puts to &quot;hedge&quot; a bad stock<br>
  - Sell the stock instead if you lack conviction

<h2>Advanced Example: Synthetic Covered Call</h2>
<div class="example-block">
  Synthetic Covered Call = Long 100 shares + Short 1 call<br>
  Alternative = Long call + Short 2 calls (ratio)<br><br>
  <strong>Example with derivatives only:</strong><br>
  - Buy 1 AAPL $175 call for $6<br>
  - Sell 2 AAPL $185 calls for $2 each = $4 income<br>
  - Net cost: $6 - $4 = $2 debit<br>
  - Risk profile similar to owning stock and selling call<br>
  - No stock ownership required<br>
  - More capital efficient<br><br>
  This is more advanced, but shows how strategies combine

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Covered Call</strong>: Sell income from stock you already own; cap upside to collect premium</li>
<li><strong>Protective Put</strong>: Buy insurance on stock you own; pay premium for downside protection</li>
<li><strong>Covered Call</strong> = income generation (bearish on further upside)</li>
<li><strong>Protective Put</strong> = risk management (cautiously bullish)</li>
<li><strong>Both strategies</strong> involve owning the underlying stock</li>
<li><strong>Neither strategy</strong> is free; tradeoffs exist in every scenario</li>
</ol>

<h2>In the Next Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lesson 11.4 introduces the Greeks—the variables that drive option prices</li>
<li>Understanding Greeks helps you optimize both covered calls and protective puts</li>
<li>Greeks also form the foundation for more complex strategies</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Self-Assessment Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>You own AAPL at $180. You sell the $190 call for $2. If AAPL rises to $200, what's your profit?</li>
<li>You own TSLA at $250. You buy the $240 put for $3. If TSLA falls to $200, what's your outcome?</li>
<li>Why might an investor prefer a protective put over just selling the stock?</li>
<li>When would a covered call strategy cost you upside profits?</li>
<li>If you sold a covered call and the stock was called away, what happens next?</li>
</ol>
