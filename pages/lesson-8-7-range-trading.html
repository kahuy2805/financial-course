                <h1>Lesson 8.7: Range Trading (Sideways Markets)</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify range-bound trading environments</li>
<li>Trade support and resistance within ranges</li>
<li>Use range trading in sideways markets</li>
<li>Apply proper position sizing for range trading</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Range Trading?</h2>
<p>Range trading captures price movement within defined support and resistance levels in sideways (non-trending) markets.</p>
<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Trading within established support and resistance levels</li>
<li><strong>Market Type</strong>: Sideways consolidation (no clear trend)</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Buy at support, sell at resistance repeatedly</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2-7 days per trade</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Multiple trades per week possible</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Tight stop losses above/below range</li>
</ul>
<h2>Market Conditions for Range Trading</h2>
<h3>Identifying Range-Bound Markets</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Range-Bound Characteristics:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Price oscillating between two levels</li>
        <li>No clear directional trend (not higher highs or lower lows)</li>
        <li>Support level: Holds multiple times</li>
        <li>Resistance level: Rejects multiple times</li>
        <li>Volatility: Lower than trending markets</li>
        <li>Volume: Below average (indecision)</li>
    </ul>
  <strong>Example Visual:</strong><br>
  ▲ Resistance $110<br>
  |<br>
  ─────────────────  $105 average<br>
  |<br>
  ▼ Support $100<br><br>
  <strong>Observations:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Price bounces off support ($100) 3 times</li>
        <li>Price rejected at resistance ($110) 2 times</li>
        <li>3-week consolidation pattern</li>
        <li>Volume declining (indecision)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Range Identification Checklist</h3>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>Range Identification Checklist:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify recent high: $155.00</li>
        <li>Identify recent low: $145.00</li>
        <li>Range exists: $145-$155 (10-point range)</li>
        <li>Midpoint: $150.00</li>
    </ul>
  <strong>Method 2: Multiple touches</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Support: Level where price bounced 3+ times</li>
        <li>Resistance: Level where price rejected 3+ times</li>
        <li>Example:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Support $145 (bounced 3/5 attempts)</li>
            <li>Resistance $155 (rejected 2/4 attempts)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <strong>Method 3: Technical levels</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Previous swing high = Resistance</li>
        <li>Previous swing low = Support</li>
        <li>Moving average (20-day or 50-day) = Mid-range</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Strategy 3: Midpoint Scalp Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Quick profits from midpoint oscillation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Range: $100-$110 (10-point range)

Midpoint: $105



Setup:

- Price bounces between support ($100) and resistance ($110)

- Oscillates around midpoint ($105)

- Trade is near midpoint



Scalp Trade Entry 1:

- Price at midpoint $105

- Bouncing from support

- Entry: Buy $105.10

- Stop: $104.50 (-$30)

- Target: $107.50 (+$72)

- Hold: 1-2 days

These can repeat 3-5× per week

</code></pre>
<h2>Range Trading with Position Sizing</h2>
<h3>Conservative Approach (1% risk per trade)</h3>
<pre><code>
Account: $20,000

Risk per trade: 1% = $200



Stock: XYZ in $50-$55 range



Trade 1 - Support bounce:

- Entry: $50.50

- Stop: $49.00 (-$1.50 per share)

- Position size: $200 / $1.50 = 133 shares

- Capital needed: 133 × $50.50 = $6,716



Risk management: Maximum 2 trades simultaneously

- Trade 1 ($200 risk) + Trade 2 ($200 risk) = $400 total risk

- Below daily risk limit (2-3% = $400-600)

</code></pre>
<h3>Aggressive Approach (Multiple simultaneous trades)</h3>
<pre><code>
Account: $20,000

Daily risk budget: 2% = $400

Trades per day: Up to 4 range trades



Trade 1: $100 risk (0.5%)

Trade 2: $100 risk (0.5%)

Trade 3: $100 risk (0.5%)

Trade 4: $100 risk (0.5%)



Total: $400 risk (2% daily limit)



This works ONLY if:

- Each trade has defined stop loss

- Trades are in different stocks (diversified)

- All stops are respected (discipline)

- Daily P&amp;L is tracked

</code></pre>
<h2>Range Trading Entry and Exit</h2>
<h3>Precise Entry Execution</h3>
<pre><code>
Entry at Support:

1. Price approaches support level

2. Wait for candlestick confirmation

   - Green candle bouncing from support

   - Volume increasing on bounce

3. Enter on close of confirmation candle

4. OR use limit order at support level



Example:

- Support: $100

- Price at $100.30 (approaching)

- Candle pattern: Hammer or bullish engulfing

- Entry: Limit order at $100.50

- Execute: Gets filled as bounce begins

</code></pre>
<h3>Exit Management in Ranges</h3>
<pre><code>
Exit at Resistance:

1. Price approaches resistance level

2. Cancel any remaining buy orders

3. Monitor rejection patterns:

   - Shooting star (high wick, lower close)

   - Bearish engulfing

   - Volume spike at resistance

4. Exit near resistance, don&#39;t wait for perfect

5. Use limit order to sell at target



Partial Exits:

- 50% position at first target (1:1 risk-reward)

- 50% position at resistance (approaching 1:1.5)

- Gives flexibility if resistance breaks



Stop Loss Discipline:

- Market order at stop loss level

- NO exceptions

- Range WILL break eventually

- Protect capital

</code></pre>
<h2>Range Duration and Breakout Warning</h2>
<h3>How Long Do Ranges Last?</h3>
<pre><code>
Typical Range Durations:

- Short ranges: 2-4 weeks (usually break)

- Medium ranges: 4-8 weeks (extended consolidation)

- Long ranges: 8+ weeks (major reversal often)



General Rule:

- Most ranges break within 4-6 weeks

- If range persists 8+ weeks, reversal likely

- Be aware of time limit for range trades



Fade ranges lasting 3+ months:

- Probability of breakout increases

- Reduce position size

- Tighter stops

- Prepare for range break scenario

</code></pre>
<h3>Signs of Range Breakout Coming</h3>
<pre><code>
Decreasing volume:

- Volume declining into range

- Lack of buying/selling pressure

- Breakout coming (but which direction?)

- Reduce position size



Increasing volatility:

- Range widening (high-low distance increasing)

- More extreme reversals within range

- Pressure building for breakout

- Reduce position size or exit



Price penetrating levels:

- Support broken (even slightly)

- OR resistance broken

- Could be false breakout, but increase caution

- Exit range positions immediately



Catalyst events:

- Earnings announcement approaching

- Major economic data

- News release imminent

- Reduce/exit range trades pre-event

<h2>Range Trading with Technical Indicators</h2>
<h3>RSI in Ranges</h3>
<pre><code>
RSI interpretation in ranges:

- RSI &gt; 70: Overbought, sell/short signal

- RSI &lt; 30: Oversold, buy signal

- RSI 40-60: Range middle, neutral

- RSI extreme: Exit signal



Example:

Range: $100-$110

- Price at $100.50 (support)

- RSI: 25 (oversold)

- BUY setup confirmed

- Entry: $100.50, Target: $109.00



- Price at $108.00 (near resistance)

- RSI: 72 (overbought)

- EXIT or SHORT setup

- Sell/cover at $109.00

</code></pre>
<h3>Bollinger Bands in Ranges</h3>
<pre><code>
Bollinger Bands setup for range trading:

- Upper band: Resistance

- Lower band: Support

- Moving average: Range midpoint



Trade Setup:

- Price touches lower band = BUY

- Price touches upper band = SELL/SHORT

- Price near middle band = Wait/Exit



Tight bands = Narrow range (good for trading)

Wide bands = Wide range (less frequent trades)

Band squeeze = Breakout coming (exit positions)

</code></pre>
