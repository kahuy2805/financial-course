<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You've learned how to place trades and choose order types. Now it's time to understand the hidden costs: bid-ask spread and why some stocks are easy to trade (liquid) while others are difficult. This lesson explains how spreads cost you money, what liquidity means, and how to choose liquid stocks for easier trading.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 15-20 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completed Lessons 2.1-2.5 (broker, accounts, quotes, trading, order types)</li>
<li>Understand bid and ask prices from Lesson 2.3</li>
<li>Comfortable with basic math</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>The Bid-Ask Spread Concept</h3>
<p>Remember from Lesson 2.3: Every stock has two prices simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bid:</strong> What buyers will PAY (highest price someone offers)</li>
<li><strong>Ask:</strong> What sellers want to RECEIVE (lowest price someone will accept)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bid-Ask Spread:</strong> The gap between these two prices.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Microsoft (MSFT) Quote:

Bid: $330.45 (someone will buy at this price)

Ask: $330.47 (someone will sell at this price)

Spread: $0.02 (the gap)

</code></pre>
<h3>Why the Spread Exists</h3>
<p><strong>The Simple Reason:</strong> Market makers profit from the spread.</p>
<p><strong>How Market Makers Work:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you run a currency exchange stand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tourists come wanting USD</li>
<li>You buy euros from sellers at $1.08 per euro</li>
<li>You sell euros to buyers at $1.10 per euro</li>
<li>Your profit: $0.02 per euro (the spread)</li>
</ul>
<p>This works because you're providing a service (instant liquidity).</p>
<p><strong>Stock Market Equivalent:</strong></p>
<p>A market maker is a company that constantly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buys stock</strong> from sellers at the bid price (slightly lower)</li>
<li><strong>Holds it</strong> momentarily</li>
<li><strong>Sells stock</strong> to buyers at the ask price (slightly higher)</li>
<li><strong>Profits</strong> from the difference</li>
</ol>
<p>This is entirely legal and standard.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters to You:</strong></p>
<p>When you buy a stock, you pay the ask price (higher).</p>
<p>When you sell a stock, you receive the bid price (lower).</p>
<p>You lose the spread on both sides of every trade.</p>
<h3>The Cost of the Spread</h3>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>You decide to buy and immediately sell Apple to test trading:</p>
<pre><code>
Buying:

  Current ask: $195.48

  You buy 100 shares

  Cost: 100 × $195.48 = $19,548



Selling immediately:

  Current bid: $195.45

  You sell 100 shares

  Proceeds: 100 × $195.45 = $19,545



Net Loss: $19,548 - $19,545 = $3

(This is just from the spread!)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Annual Cost Example:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you make 10 trades per year. Average spread is $0.05 per share. You trade 100 shares each time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per trade: 100 × $0.05 = $5</li>
<li>Cost per year: 10 × $5 = $50</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn't sound like much? But over 30 years, that's $1,500 lost just to spreads (not counting opportunity cost of that money).</p>
<h3>Spreads Vary by Stock</h3>
<p><strong>Wide vs Narrow Spreads:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Apple (AAPL) - Large, Liquid Stock:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bid: $195.47

Ask: $195.48

Spread: $0.01 (one penny!)

Spread %: 0.005% of price

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Small Tech Company (TINY) - Illiquid Stock:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Bid: $12.50

Ask: $13.00

Spread: $0.50

Spread %: 4% of price

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Same dollar amount ($0.50) is much worse as a percentage on cheaper stock!</p>
<p><strong>Why spreads vary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquid stocks</strong> (lots of trading): Tight spreads (narrow)</li>
<li><strong>Illiquid stocks</strong> (few traders): Wide spreads</li>
<li><strong>Volatile stocks</strong> (price moving fast): Wider spreads</li>
<li><strong>Stable stocks</strong> (price steady): Tighter spreads</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Liquidity?</h3>
<p><strong>Liquidity:</strong> How easily you can buy or sell without affecting the price.</p>
<p><strong>Think of it like:</strong> How easy is something to turn into cash?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash:</strong> Most liquid (instant)</li>
<li><strong>Stock of Apple:</strong> Very liquid (thousands of trades per second)</li>
<li><strong>Stock of tiny company:</strong> Illiquid (few trades per day)</li>
<li><strong>House:</strong> Illiquid (takes months to sell)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Liquidity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many buyers and sellers</li>
<li>Tight bid-ask spread</li>
<li>Can buy/sell large amounts quickly</li>
<li>Minimal impact on price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Low Liquidity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Few buyers and sellers</li>
<li>Wide bid-ask spread</li>
<li>Hard to sell large amounts quickly</li>
<li>Your order might move the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Liquidity Through Examples</h3>
<p><strong>Highly Liquid Stock (Apple - AAPL):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Current prices: Bid $195.47, Ask $195.48

Recent trades (last 5 seconds):

- 1,000 shares bought at $195.48

- 2,500 shares sold at $195.47

- 500 shares bought at $195.48

- 3,000 shares sold at $195.46

- 1,200 shares bought at $195.48



What this means:

- Constant buying and selling

- Tight spread ($0.01)

- Easy to enter/exit position

- Any size order fills quickly

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Illiquid Stock (Small Company - TINY):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Current prices: Bid $12.50, Ask $13.00

Recent trades (last 5 seconds):

- Nothing

- Nothing

- Nothing

- One 100-share trade at $12.75

- Nothing



What this means:

- Few trades happening

- Wide spread ($0.50)

- Hard to find a buyer/seller

- Large orders might not fill quickly

- Price might move a lot if you try to sell

</code></pre>
<h3>Impact of Illiquidity</h3>
<p><strong>You want to sell 10,000 shares of tiny company:</strong></p>
<p>Scenario A: At bid price of $12.50</p>
<ul>
<li>You get: 10,000 × $12.50 = $125,000</li>
<li>But your 10,000 shares is 1% of daily volume</li>
<li>Broker needs time to find buyers</li>
<li>Might not get $12.50 for all shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenario B: Desperate to sell</p>
<ul>
<li>You place market order</li>
<li>Might only find buyers at $12.00, $11.50, $11.00</li>
<li>Might get $110,000 instead of $125,000</li>
<li>Loss: $15,000 (12% loss!) from illiquidity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measuring Liquidity: Volume</h3>
<p><strong>Volume</strong> is the key liquidity indicator.</p>
<p><strong>What it tells you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of shares traded in a day</li>
<li>High volume = Liquid (easy to trade)</li>
<li>Low volume = Illiquid (hard to trade)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rough Guide:</strong></p>
<p>| Daily Volume | Liquidity | Spread | Ease |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 1M+ shares/day | Highly liquid | Tight | Very easy |</p>
<p>| 100K-1M shares | Liquid | Moderate | Easy |</p>
<p>| 10K-100K shares | Somewhat liquid | Wide | Moderate |</p>
<p>| Under 10K shares | Illiquid | Very wide | Hard |</p>
<p><strong>Real Examples:</strong></p>
<p>| Stock | Daily Volume | Spread | Situation |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Apple (AAPL) | 50M+ shares | $0.01 | Super liquid |</p>
<p>| Coca-Cola (KO) | 10M shares | $0.02 | Very liquid |</p>
<p>| Small cap (TINY) | 100K shares | $0.50-2.00 | Illiquid |</p>
<p>| Penny stock (PENNY) | 10K shares | $0.10-0.50 | Very illiquid |</p>
<h3>The Relationship: Spread, Volume, and Price</h3>
<p><strong>Understanding the connections:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
High Volume → More buyers/sellers → Competition → Tight spread

Low Volume → Few buyers/sellers → Less competition → Wide spread



Tight Spread → Easier to trade → Less cost → Good for traders

Wide Spread → Harder to trade → More cost → Bad for traders

</code></pre>
<h3>Real Cost Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Let's calculate actual trading costs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Buying Apple (Liquid)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Price: $195.48

Volume: 50M shares/day

Spread: $0.01



You buy 100 shares:

Market price: $195.48 (ask)

You pay: 100 × $195.48 = $19,548

Spread cost: 100 × $0.01 = $1 (0.005% of trade)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Buying Illiquid Small Cap (Illiquid)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Price: $15.00

Volume: 50K shares/day

Spread: $1.00



You buy 100 shares:

Market price: $15.50 (ask) [might be higher than listed bid]

You pay: 100 × $15.50 = $1,550

Spread cost: 100 × $1.00 = $100 (6.5% of trade)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Same $1,550 investment, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple: $1 cost (0.005%)</li>
<li>Small cap: $100 cost (6.5%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> You'd need Apple to go up just 0.05% to break even on spread. Small cap needs to go up 6.5%. That's 130x harder!</p>
<h3>Choosing Liquid Stocks</h3>
<p><strong>How to ensure liquidity:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Check Daily Volume</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for stocks with 1M+ daily volume</li>
<li>Especially if trading large positions</li>
<li>Check volume on quotes (Yahoo Finance, your broker)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Look at Spread Size</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quote shows bid-ask spread</li>
<li>If spread is more than 1% of price, be cautious</li>
<li>Tight spreads (penny or less) are ideal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Use Limit Orders for Illiquid Stocks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use market orders on illiquid stocks</li>
<li>Use limit orders to control your worst price</li>
<li>Willing to wait for execution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Avoid Penny Stocks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Penny stocks (under $5) are usually illiquid</li>
<li>Spreads can be 5-20% of price</li>
<li>Very hard to exit positions</li>
<li>High cost and risk</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Stick to Established Companies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large-cap stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Google)</li>
<li>Mid-cap established names (Intel, Cisco)</li>
<li>These almost always have good liquidity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Liquidity Matters for Different Traders</h3>
<p><strong>For Long-Term Investors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity matters less</li>
<li>You buy and hold for years</li>
<li>One-time spread cost is tiny over decades</li>
<li>Can afford to buy less liquid stocks if research is good</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Active Traders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity matters a lot</li>
<li>Making many trades means many spread costs</li>
<li>Small spreads compound to big savings</li>
<li>Need to trade liquid stocks only</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Beginners:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with highly liquid stocks (Apple, Microsoft, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid illiquid stocks while learning</li>
<li>Makes execution simpler and errors less costly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hidden Costs Beyond Spread</h3>
<p><strong>Be aware of other costs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commission (Usually $0 now):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used to be $5-50 per trade</li>
<li>Now mostly $0</li>
<li>Some limit orders might have small fees</li>
<li>Check your broker's fee schedule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slippage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Market order might fill worse than quoted</li>
<li>Costs a few cents usually</li>
<li>Worse in volatile markets</li>
<li>Use limit orders to prevent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact Cost:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large orders might move price</li>
<li>If buying 10,000 shares of illiquid stock</li>
<li>Your demand pushes price up</li>
<li>Later shares cost more than first</li>
<li>More relevant for very large orders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Sarah's Trading Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Trade 1: Apple (Good Choice)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buying 100 shares</li>
<li>Price: $195.48</li>
<li>Volume: 50M shares/day</li>
<li>Spread: $0.01</li>
<li>Execution: Order fills immediately at $195.48</li>
<li>Spread cost: $1</li>
<li>Sarah: Happy, easy trade</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trade 2: Obscure Biotech Stock (Bad Choice)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buying 100 shares</li>
<li>Price: $18.00</li>
<li>Volume: 2,000 shares/day (very low!)</li>
<li>Spread: $1.50</li>
<li>Sarah places market order</li>
<li>Filled at $19.50 (worse than expected)</li>
<li>Spread cost: $150</li>
<li>Sarah: Frustrated, paid much more than expected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sarah's Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Always check volume before buying. The spread would have told her this was illiquid.</p>
<h3>Marcus's Cost Awareness</h3>
<p>Marcus makes 20 trades per year. Let's calculate his spread costs:</p>
<p><strong>If trading liquid stocks (Apple, Microsoft, etc.):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Average spread: $0.02 per share</li>
<li>Shares per trade: 100</li>
<li>Cost per trade: 100 × $0.02 = $2</li>
<li>Annual cost: 20 × $2 = $40</li>
<li>Over 30 years: $40 × 30 = $1,200</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If trading illiquid stocks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Average spread: $0.50 per share</li>
<li>Shares per trade: 100</li>
<li>Cost per trade: 100 × $0.50 = $50</li>
<li>Annual cost: 20 × $50 = $1,000</li>
<li>Over 30 years: $1,000 × 30 = $30,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difference:</strong> $30,000 lost just from choosing illiquid stocks!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Ignoring Spread as a Cost</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Spread is a real cost that reduces returns. It adds up across many trades.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Trading Illiquid Stocks Without Limit Orders</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Market orders on illiquid stocks can cost you a lot. Use limit orders or avoid illiquid stocks.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Not Checking Volume Before Buying</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Check volume! It tells you if spread will be tight or wide before you trade.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Assuming Tight Spread = Good Stock</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Tight spread means easy to trade, but doesn't mean good investment. Still research the company.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Panic Selling Illiquid Positions</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> If you own illiquid stock, selling it can cost a lot. Maybe better to hold than take 5-10% loss to spreads.</p>
<h3>Mistake #6: Trying to Scalp (Rapid Buy-Sell) Illiquid Stocks</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Spreads will destroy you. Scalping only works with highly liquid stocks.</p>
<h3>Mistake #7: Not Understanding Your Broker's Quote Quality</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Some brokers show real-time quotes, others show delayed. Real-time lets you trade at prices you see.</p>

<h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Spread Analysis</h3>
<p>Look up 3 stocks and analyze their spreads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple (AAPL)</li>
<li>Microsoft (MSFT)</li>
<li>A small-cap stock you're curious about</li>
</ol>
<p>For each, record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current bid price</li>
<li>Current ask price</li>
<li>Bid-ask spread (dollar amount)</li>
<li>Spread as % of price</li>
<li>Daily volume</li>
<li>Which has tightest spread?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise 2: Cost Comparison</h3>
<p>Calculate spread costs for two different trading styles:</p>
<p><strong>Conservative (10 trades/year, $500 per trade):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume average spread: $0.03</li>
<li>Total cost: ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Active trader (100 trades/year, $2,000 per trade):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume average spread: $0.05</li>
<li>Total cost: ?</li>
</ul>
<p>How much more does active trader pay?</p>
<h3>Exercise 3: Liquidity Decision</h3>
<p>For each stock situation, decide: Safe to trade or not?</p>
<ol>
<li>Stock A: Price $150, volume 500K/day, spread $0.05</li>
<li>Stock B: Price $8, volume 5K/day, spread $0.50</li>
<li>Stock C: Price $100, volume 50M/day, spread $0.01</li>
<li>Stock D: Price $75, volume 100K/day, spread $0.10</li>
</ol>
<p>For each, explain your reasoning.</p>
<h3>Exercise 4: Real Trade Scenario</h3>
<p>You want to invest $5,000. You're considering two stocks:</p>
<p>Stock 1 (Liquid): AAPL at $195, 50M daily volume, $0.01 spread</p>
<p>Stock 2 (Illiquid): TINY at $50, 10K daily volume, $2.00 spread</p>
<p>For each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate number of shares you can buy ($5,000 ÷ price)</li>
<li>Calculate spread cost</li>
<li>Calculate spread as % of investment</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is cheaper to buy?</p>
<h3>Exercise 5: Volume Checking Habit</h3>
<p>Practice checking volume before every trade:</p>
<p>Next time you consider buying a stock:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the ticker on Yahoo Finance</li>
<li>Find the daily volume</li>
<li>Check if it's above 1M</li>
<li>If not, find another stock</li>
<li>Make this a habit before every trade</li>
</ol>
