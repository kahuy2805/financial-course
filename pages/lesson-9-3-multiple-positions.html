<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<li>Track and monitor multiple open positions simultaneously</li>
<li>Manage entries, exits, and stops across portfolio</li>
<li>Balance opportunity with risk across positions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges of Multiple Positions</h2>
<h3>Why Multiple Positions Are Hard</h3>
Single position (simple):
- One entry to monitor
- One stop loss to track
- One target to manage
- Focus: 100%



Multiple positions (complex):

- Monitor 4 entries simultaneously

- Track 4 stop losses (any could trigger)

- Manage 4 different targets

- Mental energy divided by position count

- Decision fatigue increases errors



Psychological pressures with multiple positions:
1. Attention deficit: Can&#39;t watch all equally
2. Decision fatigue: More decisions = worse decisions
3. Revenge trading: Loss in one position creates emotional trade in another
4. Portfolio view vs. position view: Hard to balance all positions together

5. Capital allocation: Which position gets more focus if both need attention?



Managing the complexity:

- Automate: Use alerts and pre-set stop losses

- Systematic: Checklist for monitoring

- Reduce: Start with fewer positions, build up

- Focus: Dedicate time to review (not constant watching)

</code></pre>
<h3>Position Tracking Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>Create a simple tracker:</p>
<pre><code>
| Ticker | Entry | Current | Stop | Target | Risk | Shares | P&amp;L | % P&amp;L |

|--------|-------|---------|------|--------|------|--------|-----|-------|

| AAPL   | 180   | 185     | 175  | 195    | $250 | 50     | $250 | 1.4%  |

| MSFT   | 350   | 348     | 340  | 370    | $500 | 20     | -40  | -0.2% |

| NVDA   | 850   | 870     | 830  | 920    | $800 | 24     | $480 | 2.3%  |

| AMD    | 105   | 103     | 100  | 120    | $150 | 30     | -60  | -0.3% |



Portfolio Summary:

Total deployed: $26,350

Total risk: $1,700

Total P&amp;L: +$630

Portfolio %: +2.4%

Positions in profit: 2/4 (50% win rate)

Largest winner: NVDA (+2.3%)

Largest loser: MSFT (-0.2%)

</code></pre>
<h2>Position Correlation</h2>
<h3>Understanding Position Correlation</h3>
<pre><code>
Correlation definition:

- Measure of how two positions move together

- Range: -1 to +1

  - +1 = Perfectly correlated (move same direction together)

  - 0 = No correlation (move independently)

  - -1 = Perfectly inverse (move opposite)



Example - Highly correlated (+0.8):

- NVDA and AMD (both semiconductors)

- When NVDA up 5%, AMD usually up 4-5%

- When NVDA down 3%, AMD usually down 3-4%

- Risk: If sector crashes, both crash together



Example - Uncorrelated (0.2):

- AAPL and JPM (tech vs. finance)

- AAPL up 5%, JPM might be flat or down

- Different sectors, different drivers

- Benefit: Portfolio diversification



Example - Inverse correlated (-0.3):

- Tech stocks and Treasury bonds

- Tech up, bonds often down (interest rate risk)

- Tech down, bonds often up (flight to safety)

- Good for hedging

</code></pre>
<h3>Calculating Portfolio Correlation</h3>
<pre><code>
For 2 positions:

- Position 1 (MSFT): Up 5% this week

- Position 2 (AAPL): Up 4% this week

- Correlation: HIGH (+0.8 to +0.9)



For 2 positions:

- Position 1 (AAPL): Up 5% this week

- Position 2 (JPM): Up 1% this week

- Correlation: LOW to MEDIUM (+0.3 to +0.5)



For 2 positions:

- Position 1 (AAPL): Up 5% this week

- Position 2 (TLT bonds): Down 2% this week

- Correlation: INVERSE (-0.3 to -0.5)



Portfolio screening:

If all positions move together (correlation +0.9):

- Portfolio acts like single position

- Diversification not working

- Problem: All 4 positions in tech = concentrated risk



If positions spread across correlations:

- Some +0.5 correlation (sector related)

- Some 0.0 correlation (independent)

- Some -0.3 correlation (inverse hedge)

- Benefits: True diversification

</code></pre>
<h2>Position Management Across Portfolio</h2>
<h3>Entry Management with Multiple Positions</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
You have 3 open positions. You identify a 4th high-quality entry.



Decision: Add 4th position?



Analysis:

Current portfolio:

- AAPL: Long, $5,000, 1.5% risk

- MSFT: Long, $6,000, 2% risk

- AMD: Long, $4,000, 1.5% risk

- Total deployed: $15,000 of $20,000 account

- Total risk: $175 (5%)

- Cash available: $5,000



New entry opportunity:

- NVDA: 2% risk = $400

- Capital needed: $6,000 (30% of account)

- Would exceed total capital!



Options:

1. Reduce existing position size

2. Exit weaker position to make room

3. Wait for better opportunity later

4. Pass on 4th position (focus on 3 best ideas)



Recommendation:

- Exit AMD (weakest setup)

- Add NVDA (stronger momentum)

- Keeps portfolio at 3 positions

- Better capital allocation

</code></pre>
<h3>Exit Management with Multiple Positions</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
All 4 positions hitting targets simultaneously.



Position 1 (AAPL): Hit Target 1 (1:1 risk-reward)

- Decision: Sell 1/3 position

- Lock in: $83 profit

- Keep 2/3 running for Target 2



Position 2 (MSFT): Hit Target 1 (1:1 risk-reward)

- Decision: Sell 1/3 position

- Lock in: $166 profit

- Keep 2/3 running for Target 2



Position 3 (AMD): Down approaching stop loss

- Decision: Exit position before stop

- Lock in: -$75 loss (protect remaining capital)

- Free up capital for new opportunity



Position 4 (NVDA): Extended move, no momentum confirmation

- Decision: Hold, but tighten stop to cost basis

- Reduce risk but preserve upside

- Exit if support breaks



Portfolio outcome:

- Took partial profits: +$249

- Exited loss: -$75

- Net portfolio: +$174

- Capital freed: $4,500

- Remaining positions: 3 full + 2 partial

</code></pre>
<h3>Stop Loss Management</h3>
<p><strong>Coordinating stops across portfolio:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position 1 - AAPL:

- Stop: $175 (5% from entry $180)

- Status: FIRM (maintains discipline)



Position 2 - MSFT:

- Stop: $340 (3% from entry $350)

- Note: Wider stop due to volatility

- Status: FIRM



Position 3 - AMD:

- Stop: $100 (5% from entry $105)

- Status: FIRM



Position 4 - NVDA:

- Stop: $830 (2% from entry $850, very tight)

- Reason: Highest volatility stock

- Status: Monitor carefully



Portfolio risk summary:

- If all stops hit: Maximum loss $1,175

- Risk as % of account: 5.9% (at tolerance)

- Any single position hitting stop acceptable

- Multiple stops hitting = RED FLAG



Action if 2 stops hit same day:

- Reassess portfolio

- Reduce position sizes

- Increase cash reserve

- Consider market condition (crash?)

</code></pre>
<h2>Managing Profitable Positions</h2>
<h3>Scaling Out of Winners</h3>
<p><strong>Systematic profit-taking approach:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: 100 shares MSFT at $350 (cost $35,000)

Stock rallies to $370 (+5.7%)

Profit: +$2,000



Scale-out strategy:

Target 1 ($360): Sell 1/3 (33 shares)

- Partial profit: $330

- Remaining: 67 shares



Target 2 ($375): Sell 1/3 (33 shares)

- Partial profit: +$825

- Total profit so far: +$1,155

- Remaining: 34 shares



Target 3 (+15% from entry = $402.50): Sell final 1/3

- Final profit: +$1,530

- Total profit: +$2,685 (7.7% gain on capital)



Benefits of scaling:

- Lock in gains incrementally

- Reduce emotional attachment to position

- Free capital for new opportunities

- Sleep better knowing some profit captured

- Participate in remaining upside



Alternative: &quot;Give it back&quot; approach

- Sell 1/3 at Target 1: +$330

- Move stop to cost basis: $350

- Remaining 2/3 can move for free (no additional risk)

- Becomes a &quot;free ride&quot; on remainder

</code></pre>
<h3>Knowing When to Hold Winners</h3>
<pre><code>
Hold criteria:

☐ Trend still intact (price &gt; 50-day MA)

☐ Momentum continuing (RSI 50-70, not exhausted at 80+)

☐ Technical support holding (higher lows maintained)

☐ Sector momentum supporting (not fighting sector decline)

☐ Time hasn&#39;t reached target hold (too early to exit)

☐ MACD histogram not rolling over (momentum failing)



Exit criteria:

☐ Target price reached (locked in profit)

☐ Technical support broken (reversal signal)

☐ Momentum divergence (price high, MACD low)

☐ Trend broken (price below 50-day MA)

☐ Time reached maximum hold (take profits before reversal)

☐ Better opportunity elsewhere (reallocate capital)



Example:

Position: Long AAPL swing trade +8% in 5 days

Approaching previous resistance

RSI at 72 (approaching overbought)

Target was 10% gain



Decision:

- RSI says overbought

- But trend still strong

- Partially exit (1/3) at current levels

- Let 2/3 run toward $200 target

- Sets trailing stop at $185



Outcome: Captures $260 profit (partial), keeps upside

</code></pre>
<h2>Managing Losing Positions</h2>
<h3>Exit Discipline</h3>
<pre><code>
Losing position example:

- Entry: NVDA at $850

- Stop loss: $830 (set at entry)

- Current price: $832 (approaching stop)



Psychological pressure:

- &quot;If I close now, it&#39;s a real loss&quot;

- &quot;Maybe it will bounce back&quot;

- &quot;I&#39;ll give it one more day&quot;



INCORRECT thinking!

- Closed loss = Controlled loss ($18 loss = $432)

- Stop hit = Same loss anyway ($18 loss = $432)

- Bounce false hope = Often results in larger loss



Correct action:

- Place market order to exit at $830

- Accept $432 loss (2.16% of $20K account)

- Move on to next opportunity

- Preserve remaining capital



Exit discipline rules:

1. Exit on stop loss hit (no exceptions)

2. Exit on target reached (lock in profit)

3. Exit on technical break (reversal signal)

4. No &quot;hope trades&quot; (waiting for recovery)

5. No averaging down (adding to losses)

</code></pre>
<h3>Knowing When to Cut Losses Early</h3>
<pre><code>
Exit early signals:

- Thesis broken (reason for trade no longer valid)

- Entry was clearly wrong in hindsight

- Position building larger losing trend

- Psychological stress unbearable

- Capital needed for better opportunity

- Market condition changed dramatically



Example 1: Cut early to preserve capital

- Entry: TSLA at $850 (momentum setup)

- Stop loss: $830 (-$20)

- Price: $835, approaching stop

- News: Elon tweet creates doubt

- Better decision: Exit at $835 (-$15)

- Saves $5 per share vs. riding to stop



Example 2: Exit weaker position when better one emerges

- Current: AMD down -3%, stop at $100

- Opportunity: AAPL breakout, high conviction setup

- Capital available: Limited

- Decision: Exit AMD at current price (-$150)

- Free capital: $4,500

- Deploy to AAPL: Better risk-reward setup

</code></pre>
<h2>Portfolio Management During Market Stress</h2>
<h3>Extreme Market Conditions (Market crash, -5% or more)</h3>
<pre><code>
Scenario: S&amp;P 500 crashes -5% overnight

All your positions likely down 3-8%



Immediate actions (same day):

1. DON&#39;T PANIC SELL (let emotion settle)

2. Check each position:

   - Any stop losses hit? Yes/No

   - Thesis still intact? Yes/No

   - Technical support still holding? Yes/No

3. Assess portfolio losses:

   - If down 3%: Within normal volatility, hold

   - If down 8%: At risk limit, prepare to reduce

   - If down 12%+: Above tolerance, reduce positions

4. Reduce weakest positions only

   - Best positions: Hold (strong thesis)

   - Weakest positions: Exit (reduce capital at risk)

   - Medium positions: Trim (raise cash)



Portfolio management decision:

Before crash: 4 positions, 6% risk

After -8% crash: Account down $1,600

Remaining portfolio risk: 6% of $18,400 = $1,104

Action: Exit weakest position (-$400 loss realized)

New portfolio: 3 positions, 4% account risk

New cash buffer: $3,500 (19% = safer cushion)

Outcome: Reduced further crash risk



Next day decision:

- Market bounced +2%: Relief, reassess

- Market down more: Reduce further if needed

- Market stabilized: Hold and rebuild

</code></pre>
<h2>Portfolio Rebalancing During Trades</h2>
<h3>Simultaneous Profit Taking and Entry</h3>
<pre><code>
Scenario:

- AAPL position up +12%, approaching max hold time

- MSFT momentum setup triggered, high conviction



Decision:

- Realize some AAPL profit

- Deploy to MSFT setup

- Maintain overall capital usage



Execution:

1. Sell 50% of AAPL position

   - Lock in: +$2,000 profit

   - Capital freed: $5,500

   - Remaining: 50 shares AAPL for further potential



2. Enter MSFT with freed capital

   - Position size: $5,000 (match freed capital)

   - Risk: 1.5% ($300)

   - Shares: 14 shares at $350

   - Stop: $340



Portfolio transition:

- Before: 100 AAPL, 0 MSFT

- After: 50 AAPL + locked +$2,000 profit, 14 MSFT started

- Capital: Same ~$10,500 deployed

- Risk: Slightly higher but still acceptable



Benefit:

- Locked in AAPL profit (real money)

- Captured MSFT setup (new opportunity)

- Rebalanced to best opportunities
