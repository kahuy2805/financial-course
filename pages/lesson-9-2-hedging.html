- Hedge position: Short or put, profits if down

- Purpose: Limit downside while allowing upside



Simple example:

- Long 100 shares AAPL at $180



- If AAPL crashes to $150:

  - Stock loss: -$3,000

  - Put profit: +$500

  - Net loss: -$2,500 (limited!)






  - Stock profit: +$2,000

<h2>Common Hedging Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: Position Winning, Protection Before Correction</h3>
<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Your position: 100 shares MSFT at $330 (cost $33,000)

Current price: $365 (+10.6% gain)

Concern: Market due for pullback, don&#39;t want to give back gains



Hedging options:

1. Trailing stop loss: Sell if price drops 5% from high

2. Partial profit: Sell 50% position to lock in gains

3. Hedge with short: Sell short 50 shares (pair trade)

4. Hedge with puts: Buy put option (costs money)



Option 1: Trailing Stop Loss (FREE)

- High: $365

- Trailing stop: 5% below high = $346.75

- If MSFT drops to $346, sell all 100 shares

- Locks in +$1,675 profit (5% of position)

- Simple and costs nothing



Option 2: Partial Profit (LOW COST)

- Sell 50 shares at $365

- Lock in $1,750 profit (5.3%)

- Keep 50 shares to run for more gains

- If market crashes: Still holding 50 shares for recovery



Option 3: Pair Trade (FREE to negative)

- Sell short 50 shares MSFT at $365

- Long 100 shares: Profits if up, loses if down

- Short 50 shares: Profits if down, loses if up

- Net position: Long only 50 shares (50% hedged)

- Works if MSFT goes up or sideways

- Loses if MSFT drops more than gains on short 50%



Option 4: Put Hedge (COST: 1-3% of position)

- Buy put option at $355 strike for $1.50/share = $150

- Cost: 0.45% of position ($33,000)

- Protects below $355

- If MSFT drops to $340: Put worth $1,500 (limits loss to -$1,500 instead of -$2,500)

- If MSFT rallies to $375: Profit +$4,500 (insurance cost -$150 = net +$4,350)

</code></pre>
<h3>Scenario 2: Large Open Losses, Hedging to Reduce Pain</h3>
<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Your position: 50 shares TSLA at $850 (cost $42,500)

Current price: $785 (-7.6% loss)

Concern: Position could deteriorate further before reversal



Options:

1. Accept loss and exit: Sells 50 shares for -$3,250 loss (clean break)

2. Hold and hope: Risk further losses, no hedge

3. Hedge with short: Sell short against position (reduces pain)

4. Hedge with put: Buy protection



Option 3: Short Hedge (Recommended for large losses)

- Current position: Long 50 shares @ $785 (down -$3,250)

- Short 25 shares at $785 (pair trade hedge)

- Result: Long 25 shares net (50% hedged)



If TSLA continues down to $700:

- Long 50 shares: -$7,500 loss

- Short 25 shares: +$2,125 profit (sold at $785, buys back at $700)

- Net: -$5,375 loss (vs. -$7,500 without hedge)

- Reduces further losses by $2,125



If TSLA recovers to $850:

- Long 50 shares: +$3,250 gain (recovers to entry)

- Short 25 shares: -$1,625 loss (sold at $785, buys at $850)

- Net: +$1,625 gain (net recovery)

- Sacrifice some upside for downside protection



If TSLA rallies to $950:

- Long 50 shares: +$5,000 gain

- Short 25 shares: -$4,125 loss

- Net: +$875 gain (limited by hedge)

<h2>Basic Hedging Techniques</h2>
<h3>Technique 1: Partial Exit (Risk Reduction)</h3>
<p><strong>Simplest hedging method:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Concept: Sell part of winning position to lock in gains



Trade setup:

- Long 100 shares ABC at $50

- Current price: $60 (+20% gain)

- Unrealized profit: +$1,000



Partial exit:

- Sell 33 shares at $60 = $1,980

- Lock in: +$980 profit (calculated as 33 × $60 - 33 × $50)

- Remaining: 67 shares at $50 (cost basis)

- Cash freed: $1,980



New position structure:

- 67 shares still working for more gains

- $1,980 cash available to deploy elsewhere

- Worst case: 67 shares stop out = -$350 loss

- Original profit on 33 shares: +$330 (protected)

- Net worst case: -$20 loss (minimized risk!)



Benefits:

- No additional cost (no put premiums)

- Locks in real profit

- Reduces position size risk

- Provides capital for new opportunity

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Multi-Stage Partial Exits:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: 100 shares at $100



Day 1 - Stock at $110 (+10%):

- Sell 33 shares at $110

- Lock in: +$330 profit

- Remaining: 67 shares



Day 3 - Stock at $115 (+15%):

- Sell 33 shares at $115

- Lock in: +$495 profit (total: +$825)

- Remaining: 34 shares



Day 7 - Stock at $120 (+20%):

- Sell final 34 shares at $120

- Lock in: +$680 profit (total: +$1,505)

- Remaining: 0 shares



Total trade profit: +$1,505 (15% gain)

Outcome: Walk away with locked-in profits

No regret if stock crashes after you exit

</code></pre>
<h3>Technique 2: Short Hedge (Pair Trade)</h3>
<p><strong>Using opposite position for downside protection:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Setup:

- Long position: 100 shares $100 (down to $95 = -$500 loss)

- Market risk: Concerned about further decline

- Want to maintain position in case recovery happens



Implementation:

- Buy 50 shares long at $95 (original position)

- Sell short 50 shares at $95 (hedge position)

- Net result: Long only 50 shares (50% hedged)



Payoff scenarios:



1) Market continues down to $80:

   - Long 100 shares: -$2,000 total

   - Short 50 shares: +$750 profit (sold at $95, covers at $80)

   - Net: -$1,250 (reduced by 37.5%)



2) Market recovers to $100 (back to original):

   - Long 100 shares: 0 (back to breakeven)

   - Short 50 shares: -$250 loss

   - Net: -$250 (sacrifice some recovery)



3) Market rallies to $120 (strong recovery):

   - Long 100 shares: +$2,500

   - Short 50 shares: -$1,250 loss (sold at $95, covers at $120)

   - Net: +$1,250 (half of possible $2,500 gain)



Cost of hedge:

- Trading costs: 4 commissions (buy 50 original, sell short 50)

- Opportunity: Sacrifice 50% of upside

- Benefit: Limit 50% of downside risk



When to use:

- Large unrealized losses (&gt;10%)

- Conviction position still intact but timing uncertain

- Want to maintain but reduce risk

</code></pre>
<h3>Technique 3: Trailing Stop Loss (Mental Hedge)</h3>
<p><strong>Automatic protection without additional cost:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Concept: Stop loss that follows price up, protecting gains



Setup:

- Long 50 shares at $100 (entry cost $5,000)

- Initial stop: $95 (5% loss tolerance)

- Stock rallies to $110 (+10%)



Trailing stop implementation:

- Peak price: $110

- Trailing stop distance: 5% from peak

- Stop loss level: $110 - (5% × $110) = $104.50



Stock continues to $115:

- New peak: $115

- New stop loss: $115 - (5% × $115) = $109.25



Stock drops to $113:

- Still above trailing stop ($109.25)

- Position remains open

- Profit locked in if further drop



Stock drops to $108:

- Now below trailing stop ($109.25)

- Order triggers: Sell 50 shares at market

- Lock in profit: +$400 (from $100 to $108 average exit)



Benefits:

- No cost (free protection)

- Automatic exit if price deteriorates

- Locks in portion of gains

- Reduces psychological pain of large losses



Drawback:

- Can be stopped out on normal pullback

- May exit too early if trailing distance too tight

- Typical trailing stop: 5-7% for swing trades, 10% for position trades

</code></pre>
<h2>Hedging with Correlated Securities</h2>
<h3>Hedging Individual Stock Risk with Sector ETF</h3>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: Long 100 shares NVDA (semiconductor)

Concern: NVDA specific risk (earnings miss, competition)

But bullish on semiconductor sector overall



Hedging idea:

- Keep NVDA long (conviction position)

- Short SPY or sector ETF to hedge market risk

- Benefit: Upside if NVDA outperforms sector

- Limit: Downside if sector crashes



Specific setup:

- Long 100 NVDA at $850 = $85,000

- Short 20 SPY at $500 = $10,000 short

- Ratio: About 1:7 (small hedge position)



Scenarios:



1) NVDA +20%, SPY +5%:

   - NVDA profit: +$17,000

   - SPY loss: -$1,000

   - Net: +$16,000 (gets full NVDA upside)



2) NVDA -10%, SPY -15% (market crash):

   - NVDA loss: -$8,500

   - SPY profit: +$1,500

   - Net: -$7,000 (hedge reduces loss)



3) NVDA -5%, SPY +10% (sector underperformance):

   - NVDA loss: -$4,250

   - SPY loss: -$2,000

   - Net: -$6,250 (full downside, small hedge loss)



Drawback:

- Market hedge doesn&#39;t perfectly correlate

- Sometimes both positions lose

- Offset costs (commissions, borrow costs for short)

</code></pre>
<h2>Hedging Cost Analysis</h2>
<h3>When Hedging Makes Financial Sense</h3>
<pre><code>
Example: Long AAPL position $50,000



Hedge option 1: Put option

- Cost: 1.5% = $750 per month

- Annual cost: $9,000 (18% of position!)

- Protection: Limits loss below strike price



Hedge option 2: Trailing stop loss

- Cost: 0% (free)

- Protection: Automatic exit on decline

- Downside: Can be stopped out on normal pullback



Hedge option 3: Pair trade (short 50%)

- Cost: Commissions only ($50-100)

- Protection: Limits downside ~50%

- Downside: Limits upside ~50%



Financial analysis:

For put option to make sense:

- Expected crash probability &gt; cost

- Example: 20% chance crash costs 10% = 2% expected cost

- Put cost 1.5% would be worthwhile

- But uncertain crashes are unpredictable



For traders:

- Trailing stops: Always use (free, psychological benefit)

- Pair trades: Use when uncertain (cost-effective)

- Put options: Skip until experienced with options

</code></pre>
<h2>Hedging Rules for Intermediate Traders</h2>
<h3>What to Hedge</h3>
<pre><code>
Hedge when:

☐ Position is 20%+ of portfolio

☐ Position has 15%+ unrealized gain (protect profit)

☐ Position has 10%+ unrealized loss (reduce pain)

☐ Major economic event coming (Fed, earnings)

☐ Holding through overnight (gap risk)

☐ Technical setup questioned (conviction lowered)

☐ Time to take profits arrived



Don&#39;t hedge when:

☐ Position is &lt;10% of portfolio (diversified)

☐ Conviction remains high and thesis intact

☐ Stop loss is tight (already protected)

☐ Trying to &quot;not take loss&quot; (denial)

☐ Hedge cost &gt; expected loss protection

</code></pre>
<h3>Practical Rules</h3>
<pre><code>
Rule 1: Partial profit is best hedge

- After +10% gain: Sell 1/3 position

- Locks in profit with zero cost

- Recommended over other hedges



Rule 2: Tight stops are automatic hedge

- 1-2% risk per position

- Stop loss naturally limits damage

- Most effective hedge is position sizing



Rule 3: Avoid hedging losses

- Hedging losing position = Throwing good money after bad

- Accept loss with tight stop instead

- One-way bet: Either works or doesn&#39;t



Rule 4: Hedge conviction positions

- Only hedge when: Thesis intact but timing uncertain

- Example: Bullish AAPL long-term, worried short-term

- Not hedge: Uncertain whether thesis is right



Rule 5: Simple hedges work best

- Trailing stops: Simple, free, effective

- Partial exits: Simple, effective, provides capital

- Complex hedges (options): Not needed at intermediate level

</code></pre>
<h2>Hedging Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Hedging with Partial Exit</h3>
<pre><code>
Trade: Long 100 MSFT at $340

Time frame: Position trade, 12-16 week hold

Current: Week 4, Price $375 (+10.3% gain)



Situation:

- Position profitable

- Market showing warning signs (VIX rising, tech selling)

- Want to protect profit while holding core



Hedge action:

- Sell 33 shares at $375

- Lock in profit: +$1,155

- Remaining 67 shares for continued hold



New position:

- 67 shares at $340 cost basis

- Stop loss moved to $335 (cost basis - 1%)

- Target remains $420



If market corrects and MSFT drops to $320:

- Remaining 67 shares loss: -$1,340

- Original 33 shares profit locked: +$1,155

- Net: -$185 (nearly breakeven on entire trade!)



If MSFT recovers and reaches $420:

- Remaining 67 shares: +$5,360 profit

- Original 33 shares: Locked +$1,155

- Total: +$6,515 (excellent outcome)



Outcome: Hedge reduced risk while preserving upside

</code></pre>
<h3>Example 2: Hedging with Pair Trade</h3>
<pre><code>
Trade: Long 80 shares TSLA at $820

Loss: Now at $780 (-$3,200 unrealized loss)

Situation: Conviction intact, but price action weak

Timeline: Holding until $850 target or bounce



Concern: Market deteriorating, could drop to $700



Hedge action:

- Sell short 40 shares TSLA at $780

- Net position: Long 40 shares net (50% hedged)

- Risk from $780: 50 shares would lose $4,000 if drops $50

- Hedged with short 40: Only lose $2,000 if drops $50

- Hedge reduces risk by 50%



Exit scenarios:



If TSLA recovers to $850 (original target):

- Long 80: +$2,400 profit

- Short 40: -$2,800 loss (sold at $780, covers at $850)

- Net: -$400 loss (costs the hedge)



Better outcome: Exit short 40 when breakeven

- At $780: Short 40 is profitable

- Exit short 40 at $780 breakeven: 0 profit/loss

- Remaining long 40: Still owns core position

- Can still target $850 on remaining 40 shares



This demonstrates pair trade hedging for recovery scenarios
