                <h1>Lesson 11.5: Options Spread Strategies</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A <strong>spread</strong> is an options strategy involving two or more options of the same type (calls or puts) but with different strikes and/or expirations.</p>
<p>Spreads are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the cost of buying options</li>
<li>Cap risk while limiting profit</li>
<li>Create defined-risk positions</li>
<li>Trade specific market conditions with precision</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson covers three major spread categories: vertical, calendar, and diagonal spreads.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Use Spreads?</h2>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lower Cost</strong>: Selling a call offsets the cost of buying another</li>
<li><strong>Defined Risk</strong>: You know maximum loss upfront</li>
<li><strong>Defined Profit</strong>: You know maximum profit upfront</li>
<li><strong>Better Greeks</strong>: Theta is more balanced, gamma more manageable</li>
<li><strong>Precision</strong>: Trade specific outcomes, not directional bets</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example of Cost Reduction</h3>
<pre><code>
Bullish on AAPL, wants call option exposure:



Strategy 1: Buy Call (Simple)

- Buy $180 call for $3.50

- Cost: $350 per contract

- Profit: Unlimited

- Loss: Full $350 if expires worthless



Strategy 2: Buy Call, Sell Call (Bull Call Spread)

- Buy $180 call for $3.50

- Sell $185 call for $1.20

- Net cost: $3.50 - $1.20 = $2.30 = $230

- Profit: Limited to $5 × 100 = $500

- Loss: Limited to $230

- Return on investment: 217% if stock moves above $185 (better than 100%+ return)

</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>Vertical Spreads</h2>
<p>A <strong>vertical spread</strong> involves buying and selling options of the same type with the same expiration but different strikes.</p>
<p>The name comes from looking at an option chain vertically (different strikes).</p>
<h3>Bull Call Spread (Bullish Strategy)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy lower strike call (ITM or ATM)</li>
<li>Sell higher strike call (OTM)</li>
<li>Same expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
AAPL at $180, bullish outlook, 30 days to expiration



Buy $175 call for $6.50

Sell $185 call for $1.20

Net debit: $6.50 - $1.20 = $5.30 per share = $530



Risk Profile:

- Max profit: $185 - $175 - $5.30 = $4.70 per share = $470

- Max loss: Net debit = $530

- Breakeven: $175 + $5.30 = $180.30



Return on Risk: $470/$530 = 89% return if profitable

</code></pre>
<p><strong>P&L at Expiration:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock Price | Long $175 | Short $185 | Net P&amp;L

------------|----------|-----------|--------

$170        | -$5.30   | $1.20 | -$4.10 (loss)

$175        | $0       | $1.20 | $1.20 (small loss)

$180        | $5.00    | $1.20 | $6.20 - $5.30 cost = $0.90 (small profit)

$185        | $10.00   | -$5.00 | $5.00 - $5.30 cost = -$0.30 (small loss)

$190        | $15.00   | -$10.00 | $5.00 - $5.30 cost = -$0.30 (max loss)



Profit Zone: $180.30 to $185

</code></pre>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderately bullish outlook</li>
<li>Want to reduce cost of long call</li>
<li>Stock likely to rise, but not by huge amount</li>
<li>Want defined risk/reward</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Greeks Profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta: Positive (bullish)</li>
<li>Gamma: Mixed (positive on long, negative on short)</li>
<li>Theta: Slightly positive (sold premium helps)</li>
<li>Vega: Slightly negative (short premium effect)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Bear Call Spread (Bearish Strategy)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell higher strike call (OTM)</li>
<li>Buy lower strike call (ITM or ATM)</li>
<li>Same expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
AAPL at $180, bearish outlook, 30 days to expiration



Sell $185 call for $1.20

Buy $190 call for $0.40

Net credit: $1.20 - $0.40 = $0.80 per share = $80



Risk Profile:

- Max profit: $0.80 = $80 (if stock below $185)

- Max loss: $5.00 - $0.80 = $4.20 per share = $420

- Breakeven: $185 - $0.80 = $184.20



Return on Risk: $80/$420 = 19% return if profitable

</code></pre>
<p><strong>P&L at Expiration:</strong></p>

$184.20     | $0.80 | -$0.40 | $0.40 (breakeven)

$185        | $0 | -$0.40 | -$0.40 (loss)

$190        | -$5.00 | $0 | -$4.20 (max loss)



Profit Zone: Below $184.20

<ul>
<li>Moderately bearish outlook</li>
<li>Want to collect premium</li>
<li>Expect stock to stay flat or fall</li>
<li>Want defined risk with income</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Greeks Profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta: Negative (bearish)</li>
<li>Gamma: Mixed (short dominant, overall negative)</li>
<li>Theta: Positive (seller benefits from decay)</li>
<li>Vega: Positive (short OTM helps)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Bull Put Spread (Bullish Strategy, Income Focus)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell lower strike put (ITM or ATM)</li>
<li>Buy higher strike put (OTM)</li>
<li>Same expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
AAPL at $180, bullish outlook, wants income, 30 days to expiration



Sell $175 put for $3.50

Buy $170 put for $1.20

Net credit: $3.50 - $1.20 = $2.30 per share = $230



Risk Profile:

- Max profit: $2.30 = $230 (if stock above $175)

- Max loss: $5.00 - $2.30 = $2.70 per share = $270

- Breakeven: $175 - $2.30 = $172.70



Return on Risk: $230/$270 = 85% return if profitable

<hr>
<h2>Calendar Spreads (Time Spreads)</h2>
<p>A <strong>calendar spread</strong> involves buying and selling options of the same type and strike but different expirations.</p>
<h3>Strategy: Long Calendar Spread</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy far-term option (e.g., 60 days out)</li>
<li>Sell near-term option (e.g., 30 days out)</li>
<li>Same strike, same type</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
AAPL at $180, neutral outlook, 60 days to expiration



Buy $180 call (60 days): $4.00

Sell $180 call (30 days): $3.50

Net debit: $4.00 - $3.50 = $0.50 per share = $50



The Goal:

- The 30-day option decays faster (theta decay accelerates)

- Pocket the premium as it decays

- Then have long 30-day option remaining

- Repeat by selling the next 30-day call



Profit Scenario:

Day 30 (near-term expires):

- Stock still at $180 (no movement)

- Far-term now has 30 days left

- Buy it back (should be ~$2.50 instead of $4.00)

- Realize loss on long side: -$1.50



But wait... the 30-day short expired:

- Expired worthless (at-the-money)

- Already pocketed $3.50 credit

- Net: $3.50 - $1.50 = $2.00 profit on minimal move



More realistic example with theta:

Day 30:

- Stock still at $180

- Near-term expires worthless: gain $3.50

- Far-term (now 30 days out): worth $2.00

- Original cost: $4.00

- Unrealized loss: -$2.00

- Net profit: $3.50 - $2.00 = $1.50

- Return: $1.50/$50 net debit = 3000% return!

</code></pre>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Neutral outlook (stock will stay range-bound)</li>
<li>Want to profit from time decay</li>
<li>IV is stable to declining</li>
<li>Stock near resistance/support (predictable)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Greeks Profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delta: Near zero (neutral)</li>
<li>Gamma: Slightly negative (long-term dominates short-term)</li>
<li>Theta: Positive (short-term decay is faster)</li>
<li>Vega: Slightly positive (long-term IV benefits)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Diagonal Spreads</h2>
<p>A <strong>diagonal spread</strong> combines vertical and calendar spread characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different strikes AND different expirations</li>
<li>Combines directional view with time decay</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
AAPL at $180, bullish outlook, 60 days available



Buy $175 call (60 days): $6.50

Sell $185 call (30 days): $0.80

Net debit: $6.50 - $0.80 = $5.70



Benefits:

- Bullish directional position (long lower strike)

- Funded by short-term premium

- Can roll up after 30 days if bullish



If AAPL at $190 after 30 days:

- Short $185 call assigned or closed at profit

- Long $175 call now worth $15+

- Close long for large profit

<h2>Risk Management with Spreads</h2>
<h3>Position Sizing</h3>
<pre><code>
Bull Call Spread Example:

- Max risk: $530 per spread

- Account size: $50,000

- Risk per trade: 1% = $500

- Can do approximately 1 spread safely

- 2-3 spreads = 2-3% risk (aggressive)



Rule of Thumb:

- Risk no more than 2% per trade

- For $50,000 account: max $1,000 risk per trade

- Plan max loss before entering

</code></pre>
<h3>Early Exit Rules</h3>
<pre><code>
Spread becomes 50% of max profit:

- Bull call spread with $470 max profit

- When profit reaches $235, exit with profit

- Don&#39;t wait for expiration

- Lock in gains, reduce theta risk



Spread hits 50% of max loss:

- Bull call spread with $530 max loss

- When loss hits $265, exit to cut losses

- Prevents maximum loss from happening

- Protects capital

</code></pre>
<h3>Rolling Spreads</h3>
<pre><code>
Original Bull Call Spread:

- Buy $175 call, sell $185 call

- Stock rises to $190 (short call threatened)



Roll Up:

Day 1:

- Close: Sell $175 call at $16, buy $185 call at $6

- Profit on original spread: $16 - $6 - $5.30 cost = $4.70



Day 2:

- Open new spread: Buy $185 call, sell $195 call

- Different strikes, further out in time

- Extends the position with more profit potential
