                <h1>Case Study 02: Tech Bubble Burst (2021-2022) - Valuation Collapse</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>From November 2021 to December 2022, growth-heavy technology stocks crashed 67% while the broader S&P 500 fell 19%. This case study examines how valuations become disconnected from reality, why concentrated bets in "obvious winners" fail, and how to identify bubble markets before they burst.</p>
<p><strong>Time Period</strong>: November 2021 - December 2022</p>
<p><strong>Nasdaq Decline</strong>: -67% from peak (November 2021 to October 2022)</p>
<p><strong>S&P 500 Decline</strong>: -19%</p>
<p><strong>Key Lesson</strong>: Valuations matter, concentrating in bubbles destroys wealth faster than markets recover it</p>
<hr>
<h2>Background: The Setup</h2>
<h3>The Bubble Environment (Mid-2021)</h3>
<p><strong>Market Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID vaccines rolled out, "reopening trade" underway</li>
<li>Interest rates at historic lows (Fed funds rate 0%)</li>
<li>Ultra-loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus</li>
<li>Tech companies benefited massively from pandemic work-from-home</li>
<li>FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) gripped retail investors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Valuation Extremes:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Metric                  Nov 2021    Historical Average

Nasdaq PE Ratio         32.2x       16.5x (165% overvalued)

ARKK ETF PE Ratio       79.5x       20x (298% overvalued)

Tesla PE Ratio          76.8x       20x (284% overvalued)

Zoom PE Ratio           118.3x      20x (492% overvalued)

S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio        21.5x       16.5x (30% overvalued)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Popular Narratives Driving Bubble:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"Tech is the future, valuations don't matter"</li>
<li>"Growth always wins, value is dead"</li>
<li>"Disruption justifies any price"</li>
<li>"The Fed will support markets forever"</li>
<li>"FOMO is real, don't get left behind"</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Setup: Two Investor Archetypes</h3>
<p><strong>Investor A: Bubble Believer (Patricia)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Age: 38, portfolio $450,000</li>
<li>Strategy: All-in on "disruption" theme</li>
<li>Portfolio composition:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - ARKK (Growth ETF): $150,000</p>
<p>  - Tesla: $120,000</p>
<p>  - Nvidia: $80,000</p>
<p>  - Coinbase, Roku, Zoom: $50,000</p>
<p>  - S&P 500 Index: $50,000</p>
<p>  - Cash: $0</p>
<p><strong>Investor B: Concerned Realist (Marcus)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Age: 38, portfolio $450,000</li>
<li>Strategy: Tech exposure with discipline</li>
<li>Portfolio composition:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - S&P 500 Index: $250,000</p>
<p>  - Tech sector ETF: $100,000</p>
<p>  - Healthcare/Utilities: $75,000</p>
<p>  - International stocks: $25,000</p>
<p>  - Cash/Bonds: $0</p>
<p>Both investors are the SAME AGE with SAME STARTING WEALTH. The difference is portfolio composition.</p>

<p><strong>Patricia's Emotional State (November 2021):</strong></p>
<blockquote>"I feel like a genius. While everyone else was boring and safe, I saw the future. Tesla up 7.2x, Nvidia up 2.1x, ARKK up 88%. This is what happens when you have conviction and ignore the noise. My friends are asking me for advice. Maybe I should start a newsletter or invest other people's money."</blockquote>
<h3>Marcus's Position at Peak (November 2021)</h3>
<p><strong>Portfolio Value: $450,000</strong></p>
<p>| Position | Cost | Current Price | Value | Gain |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| SPY (S&P 500) | $330/share | $470 | $250,000 | +42% |</p>
<p>| QQQ (Tech heavy) | $250/share | $415 | $100,000 | +66% |</p>

<p><strong>Marcus's Emotional State (November 2021):</strong></p>
<blockquote>"I'm getting FOMO watching Patricia's returns. But my portfolio is up 46%, which beats the 42% S&P 500 return. Something feels wrong about Tesla at 76x earnings and Zoom at 118x earnings. I'm staying disciplined with diversification."</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The Crash: December 2021 - October 2022</h2>
<h3>Phase 1: The Beginning of the End (December 2021 - February 2022)</h3>
<p><strong>December 16, 2021: Fed Rate Hike Signals Start</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Reserve signals more aggressive rate hikes coming</li>
<li>Growth stocks collapse on higher rates</li>
<li>Tech-heavy Nasdaq falls faster than S&P 500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patricia's Portfolio Response:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Nov 8: $462,676

Dec 16: $385,000 (-17% in 5 weeks)

Jan 28: $322,000 (-30% from peak)

Feb 24: $285,000 (-38% from peak)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Decision Point 1: January 2022</strong></p>
<p>Patricia receives statement showing -$75,000 loss.</p>
<p>Her thought process:</p>
<blockquote>"This is temporary. Fed might pivot. Tech is the future. Now is the time to buy more, not sell. I'll add another $50,000 at these lower prices."</blockquote>
<p><strong>Patricia's Action</strong>: Margin funds to buy more ARKK</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrows $50,000 against her portfolio</li>
<li>Buys $50,000 more ARKK at $65/share</li>
<li>New position: 2,315 shares of ARKK</li>
<li>New margin debt: $50,000</li>
<li>New portfolio leverage: 1.1x (110% invested)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a CRITICAL ERROR. She's buying the worst-performing fund MORE on margin.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: The Acceleration (March - June 2022)</h3>
<p><strong>March 16, 2022: Fed Raises Rates 0.25%</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start of aggressive rate-hiking cycle</li>
<li>Growth valuations collapse further</li>
<li>Margin calls accelerate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patricia's Crash Sequence:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
March 16: $195,000 (-58% from peak, margin call warning)

April 15: $142,000 (-69% from peak, broker demands 20% reduction)

May 20: $98,000 (-79% from peak, forced liquidation begins)

June 30: $102,500 (-78% from peak, sold at worst prices)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Forced Liquidation:</strong></p>
<p>When Patricia's margin dropped below 25% of position value, her broker forced sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARKK shares: Sold 1,200 shares at $40/share = $48,000 (bought at $65, margin purchase)</li>
<li>Tesla: Sold 50 shares at $620 = $31,000 (bought at $1,229)</li>
<li>Coinbase: Sold 70 shares at $80 = $5,600 (bought at $354)</li>
<li>Rocket/Roku: Sold all = $2,800</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patricia's Actual Loss:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Starting capital invested: $450,000 + $50,000 margin = $500,000

Ending value: $102,500

Total loss: -$397,500 (-79.5%)

Margin debt remaining: $25,000 (some forced liquidation paid it off)

Personal net loss: -$422,500

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Psychological Impact:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"I feel like my life is over. I had $450,000 and I turned it into $77,500. I lost more money than many people make in 10 years. I added margin thinking it was buying an opportunity. The worst part is, I KNOW these are quality companies. I just didn't understand valuation."</blockquote>
<h3>Phase 3: The Bottom (June - October 2022)</h3>
<p>While Patricia is devastated, the market continues lower.</p>
<pre><code>
ARKK:

June 2022: $30.83

July 2022: $32.49

August 2022: $28.41

September 2022: $20.47 (new low)

October 2022: $19.67 (lowest point)



Tesla:

June 2022: $620.86

July 2022: $727.41

August 2022: $258.71

September 2022: $193.80

October 2022: $123.60 (lowest point)

</code></pre>
<p>Patricia never bought the bottom. She sold near it under forced liquidation.</p>
<h3>Marcus's Performance During Same Crash</h3>
<pre><code>
Nov 8: $450,000

Dec 16: $410,000 (-9% vs Patricia&#39;s -17%)

Jan 28: $385,000 (-14% vs Patricia&#39;s -30%)

Feb 24: $365,000 (-19% vs Patricia&#39;s -38%)

June 30: $355,000 (-21% vs Patricia&#39;s -78%)

Dec 22: $385,000 (-14% from peak)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Marcus's Emotional State:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Down 14% from peak but up 45% from 2020 bottom. My diversification protected me. The FOMO was real but it saved me. Staying disciplined meant staying alive."</blockquote>

<h2>The Bubble Analysis: How Valuations Collapsed</h2>
<h3>Valuation Compression</h3>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Multiple Contraction:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
                    Nov 2021    June 2022    Dec 2022

Tesla PE            76.8x       11.2x        33.2x (still high)

Nvidia PE           58.4x       42.3x        43.1x (still expensive)

ARKK PE             79.5x       24.5x        19.3x

S&amp;P 500 PE          21.5x       17.8x        16.2x

</code></pre>
<h3>Why Valuations Collapsed</h3>
<p><strong>Root Cause 1: Fed Policy Reversal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2021: Fed funds rate = 0%, QE ongoing</li>
<li>2022: Fed raises rates 4.25% (4 points), halts QE, discusses QT</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Discount rate for future earnings increases</li>
<li><strong>Math</strong>: Future cash flows worth less with higher rates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example with Tesla:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At 0% risk-free rate: Future earnings worth much more (90+ PE justified)</li>
<li>At 2.5% risk-free rate: Future earnings worth much less (15-20 PE fair value)</li>
<li>Tesla's earnings didn't change, but the denominator in valuation equation changed dramatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Root Cause 2: Slowing Growth Prospects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom: From $35B revenue growth to maturation</li>
<li>Roku: Slowing ad market</li>
<li>Crypto (Coinbase): Crypto winter reduced trading volume</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Root Cause 3: Inflation and Recession Fears</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation hit 40-year high in June 2022</li>
<li>Rates rising faster than expected</li>
<li>Recession risk increased</li>
<li>Growth stocks suffer most in recession fears</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Root Cause 4: Margin Call Cascades</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged investors like Patricia forced to sell</li>
<li>Sells at any price to meet margin requirements</li>
<li>Creates "death spiral" of declining prices and more forced selling</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Valuation Framework: Why Bubbles Form</h3>
<p><strong>Bubble Formation Cycle:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stage 1: Disruptive innovation emerges

  - Real business, real growth potential

  - Early investors make excellent returns

  - ARKK +88% in 2021 was based on real outperformance



Stage 2: FOMO and money floods in

  - Crowd follows successful investors

  - Price rises faster than fundamentals

  - Valuations reach 2-3x normal levels

  - Patricia adds margin to buy ARKK at $65 (already up 88%)



Stage 3: Valuations become absurd

  - Price-to-sales, price-to-revenue reach historic extremes

  - Narrative overrides math

  - &quot;Valuations don&#39;t matter&quot; becomes common phrase

  - November 2021: Zoom trading at 118x earnings



Stage 4: Catalyst breaks the spell

  - Interest rate hike (December 2021)

  - Earnings miss

  - Profit-taking

  - Something makes investors question assumptions



Stage 5: Crash and capitulation

  - Leveraged investors forced to sell

  - Margin calls cascade

  - Most violent selling when sentiment flips

  - June 2022: ARKK, Tesla, Netflix all limit down



Stage 6: Recovery (that takes years)

  - Valuations compress to reasonable levels

  - Growth eventually justifies the valuation

  - Or companies fail and valuations drop further

  - 2023-2024: Tech recovery begins, but not back to peaks

</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3>Lesson 1: Valuation Metrics Matter</h3>
<p><strong>Patricia's Mistake:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ignored that ARKK was trading at 79x earnings (vs 20x normal)</li>
<li>Ignored that Zoom at 118x earnings was unsustainable</li>
<li>Ignored that Tesla at 76x earnings left no room for disappointment</li>
<li>Thought "quality companies" made valuations irrelevant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No company grows fast enough to justify 80x earnings forever</li>
<li>At some point, high valuations require exponential growth</li>
<li>Exponential growth is impossible (mathematical reality)</li>
<li>Valuations eventually revert to means</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule for Valuation Discipline:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Fair Value PE (S&amp;P 500):        16-18x earnings

Growth Premium (Tech):          20-25x for fast growers

Bubble Level:                   40x+ (extreme caution)



If PE &gt; 50x:

- Position size: Maximum 5% of portfolio

- Conviction: Very high, but sizing reflects risk

- Leverage: Never with borrowed money

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
<p>Patricia's position was:</p>
<ul>
<li>33% of portfolio in ARKK (79x PE)</li>
<li>27% of portfolio in Tesla (76x PE)</li>
<li>Plus leverage on top</li>
</ul>
<p>This violated every principle of risk management.</p>
<h3>Lesson 2: Leverage Amplifies Both Gains AND Losses</h3>
<p><strong>The Leverage Math:</strong></p>
<p>Patricia's position at peak (with margin):</p>
<ul>
<li>Principal: $450,000</li>
<li>Margin: $50,000</li>
<li>Leverage ratio: 1.11x</li>
</ul>
<p>If portfolio falls 50%:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without leverage: $450,000 → $225,000 (lose $225,000)</li>
<li>With leverage: $500,000 invested → $250,000 value, minus $50,000 margin debt = $200,000 net (-$250,000 loss)</li>
</ul>
<p>Patricia's actual loss was worse because:</p>
<ul>
<li>She kept adding margin (increased leverage to 1.15x)</li>
<li>Margin calls forced selling at worst prices</li>
<li>Margin debt remained even after portfolio collapsed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leverage Rule:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Leverage Ratio of 1.0 (no margin):

  - 50% crash: Lose $225,000 (50% of $450,000)

  - Can weather it



Leverage Ratio of 1.11x (moderate margin):

  - 50% crash: Lose $250,000 + margin calls

  - Forced to sell at worst prices

  - Margin debt remains



Leverage Ratio of 1.5x+ (aggressive):

  - 50% crash: Forced immediate liquidation

  - Total wipeout

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Patricia's Fatal Error:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"ARKK was down 70%, a discount. I bought more on margin at $65/share thinking I was smart. I was actually doubling down on a losing position with borrowed money."</blockquote>
<p>This violated every risk management principle.</p>
<h3>Lesson 3: Concentration Risk Kills Portfolios</h3>
<p><strong>Concentration Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Patricia's portfolio (Nov 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li>33% ARKK (single ETF)</li>
<li>27% Tesla (single stock)</li>
<li>18% Nvidia (single stock)</li>
<li>11% Coinbase, Roku, Zoom (single stocks)</li>
<li>Only 11% in broad diversification (SPY)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concentration in a bubble means:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All positions correlated (all crashed together)</li>
<li>No hedge against growth collapse</li>
<li>No safety net when thesis breaks</li>
</ul>
<p>Marcus's portfolio (Nov 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li>56% Broad US market (SPY)</li>
<li>22% Tech-heavy allocation (QQQ)</li>
<li>17% Healthcare/Utilities (defensive)</li>
<li>6% International (diversification)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marcus's Nasdaq positions fell faster than S&P 500</li>
<li>But SPY holdings and defensive positions protected him</li>
<li>Net portfolio down 14% vs Patricia down 78%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concentration Rule:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position Size Guidelines:

- Cash/Bonds: 0-40% (based on risk tolerance)

- Single stocks: 5-10% max each

- Sector concentration: 30% maximum

- Alternative assets: 10% maximum

- Any single &quot;theme&quot;: 25% maximum



If investing in bubbles:

- High-valuation positions: 5% max

- Multiple high-valuation positions: Even smaller

- Never leverage a bubble position

<p>Patricia violated all of these.</p>
<h3>Lesson 4: Adding to Losing Positions in Bubbles Is Dangerous</h3>
<p><strong>The Averaging Down Fallacy:</strong></p>
<p>Patricia's thinking (January 2022):</p>
<blockquote>"ARKK is down from $121 to $75. That's a 38% discount. The same companies, cheaper prices. I should add more. This is what you're supposed to do - buy low."</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<p>In a bubble burst, you're not buying low - you're buying a broken thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARKK was down because valuations were contracting</li>
<li>The companies weren't cheaper, they were overpriced</li>
<li>Adding to a bubble bursting position = trying to catch a falling knife</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Difference:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Averaging down WORKS when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals are strong</li>
<li>The decline is temporary/sentiment-driven</li>
<li>Valuation is reasonable</li>
<li>You have spare capital for additional risk</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Averaging down FAILS when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The decline is from a bubble peak</li>
<li>Valuations are still high</li>
<li>You're using leverage</li>
<li>You're adding to the worst performers</li>
</ul>
<p>Patricia averaged down on:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARKK (worst performer, -74% by year-end)</li>
<li>Tesla (worst performer, -90% by year-end)</li>
<li>Both using leverage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
If a position is in bubble territory (80x PE):

- Never average down into a decline

- Never use leverage to add

- If you own it, take profits on rallies

- If you want exposure, buy gradually at normal valuations

</code></pre>
<h3>Lesson 5: Margin Calls Destroy Discipline</h3>
<p><strong>How Margin Calls Work:</strong></p>
<p>Patricia's broker required 30% margin maintenance (industry standard is 25-30%).</p>
<p>When portfolio drops, broker calculates:</p>
<pre><code>
Margin requirement = (Margin debt) / (Total portfolio value)



If portfolio is $500,000 (includes $50,000 margin):

- Maintenance needed: $50,000 / $500,000 = 10% (OK)



If portfolio drops to $200,000:

- Requirement: $50,000 / $200,000 = 25% (Getting close)



If portfolio drops further to $150,000:

- Requirement: $50,000 / $150,000 = 33% (MARGIN CALL!)

- Must pay $5,000 or sell $20,000 of securities

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Death Spiral:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Margin call forces sale</li>
<li>Sale at worst market prices</li>
<li>Sale creates more selling pressure</li>
<li>Prices drop further</li>
<li>Another margin call</li>
<li>Repeat until account is liquidated</li>
</ul>
<p>This is exactly what happened to Patricia:</p>
<ul>
<li>March margin call → forced to sell best performers (ARKK)</li>
<li>Selling ARKK pushed price down</li>
<li>Portfolio falls more</li>
<li>April margin call → forced to sell Tesla</li>
<li>Selling Tesla pushed price down</li>
<li>Portfolio falls more</li>
<li>June forced liquidation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Margin Rule:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Safe margin usage: Maximum 10% of portfolio

- Borrow less than 10% of portfolio value

- Maintains 90% safety buffer

- Very unlikely to trigger margin calls



Moderate margin: 10-20% of portfolio

- Higher risk

- Requires monitoring

- Can handle 40% market decline



Aggressive margin: 20%+ of portfolio

- Dangerous in any downturn

- Likely to trigger calls

- Should only be used by professionals



Patricia&#39;s situation: 11% margin + adding to it = 15%+

- Used on bubble stocks (highest risk)

- Added to losing positions

- Resulted in forced liquidation

<h2>The Comparison: Patricia vs Marcus at Year-End 2022</h2>
<h3>Patricia (Bubble Believer with Leverage)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starting capital: $450,000</li>
<li>Added via margin: $50,000</li>
<li>Ending value: $77,500</li>
<li>Remaining margin debt: $5,000 (must pay)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss: -$427,500 (-95%)</strong></li>
<li>Additional cost: Psychological trauma, destroyed confidence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marcus (Disciplined Diversifier)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starting capital: $450,000</li>
<li>Ending value: $385,000</li>
<li>Net loss: -$65,000 (-14%)</li>
<li>No debt, full dry powder</li>
<li><strong>Advantage over Patricia: $307,500</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Recovery Timeline (Into 2023-2024)</h3>
<p>By 2024, the market recovered and valuations normalized:</p>
<p>| Stock/Fund | 2022 Low | 2024 Price | Recovery |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| ARKK | $19.67 | $55.00 | +179% from low |</p>
<p>| Tesla | $123.60 | $238.42 | +93% from low |</p>
<p>| Nvidia | $113.00 | $873.00 | +672% from low |</p>
<p>| S&P 500 | $3,577 | $5,230 | +46% from low |</p>
<p><strong>Even if Patricia could hold to 2024:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Her ARKK shares sold at forced liquidation = gone</li>
<li>She's not a holder anymore</li>
<li>She's sitting in cash after the crash</li>
<li>By the time she feels comfortable buying back (March 2023), she's already missed the recovery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marcus's 2024 position:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Still held his original diversified portfolio through 2023-2024</li>
<li>Participated in full recovery</li>
<li>2024 Portfolio value: $620,000 (original $450,000 + recovery)</li>
<li><strong>Gain from lows: $235,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<h3>1. Valuations Do Matter</h3>
<p>High valuations (80x PE) aren't justified by any growth rate. Eventually, reality catches up.</p>
<h3>2. Concentration + Leverage = Portfolio Destruction</h3>
<p>Patricia's 60% allocation to ARKK + Tesla with leverage turned a bad year into a catastrophic one.</p>
<h3>3. Bubbles Are Easier to Spot in Hindsight</h3>
<p>But you can identify bubble conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valuations at multi-decade extremes</li>
<li>Narratives replacing analysis ("disruption justifies any price")</li>
<li>Leverage creeping in as accessibility</li>
<li>Retail money flooding in</li>
<li>FOMO in conversation</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Margin on Bubble Stocks Is Unforgivable Risk</h3>
<p>Margin works fine for stable positions, but on 80x PE stocks, it's gambling with forced-loss triggers.</p>
<h3>5. Diversification Prevents Catastrophe</h3>
<p>Marcus's diversification cost him 4% of returns during bubble (2021), but saved him 64% of losses during crash (2022).</p>
<h3>6. Recovery Takes Time</h3>
<p>Even great companies need years to recover from bubble valuations. Patricia could have been a 5-10 year holder, but forced liquidation removed that possibility.</p>
<h3>7. Following Momentum Into Bubbles Kills Returns</h3>
<p>Adding to ARKK at $65 (after 88% gain) was following momentum, not rational investing.</p>

<h2>Questions for Reflection</h2>
<h3>On Your Portfolio</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>What's your highest valuation position?</strong> What's its PE ratio?</li>
<li><strong>What percentage of your portfolio is in that high-valuation stock?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are you using any margin?</strong> How much?</li>
<li><strong>What would happen if your highest-conviction position fell 60%?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Would you sell?</p>
<p>   - Would you add?</p>
<p>   - Would you hold?</p>
<h3>On Valuation Discipline</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you have PE ratio rules for position sizing?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Example: "40x PE = 2% max position"</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do you decide when valuations are too high?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have you ever added to a position after a 40%+ decline?</strong> Why?</li>
</ol>
<h3>On Your Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>What's your maximum margin usage?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What's your maximum single-position size?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What's your maximum sector concentration?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What's your maximum for high-valuation stocks?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't have answers to these, you're potentially Patricia in 2021.</p>

<h2>Valuation Checklist for Your Portfolio</h2>
<p>Before holding a position at bubble valuations, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Can I explain the PE ratio to a 12-year-old?</li>
<li>[ ] Would I buy this at 2x the current price?</li>
<li>[ ] Is the position 5% or less of my portfolio?</li>
<li>[ ] Am I using zero leverage on this position?</li>
<li>[ ] Have I considered what happens if growth slows?</li>
<li>[ ] Am I holding because of fundamentals or momentum?</li>
<li>[ ] Have I already taken some profits on the way up?</li>
<li>[ ] Do I have other diversification if this crashes?</li>
<li>[ ] Can I hold this through a 50% decline without panic selling?</li>
<li>[ ] Am I adding to this position after big gains, or taking profits?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered "no" to any of these, your position sizing is too aggressive.</p>
