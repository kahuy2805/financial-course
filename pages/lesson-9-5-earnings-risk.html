<h2>Why Earnings Create Risk</h2>
<h3>Types of Earnings Risk</h3>
<pre><code>
Earnings announcement = Binary event

- Positive earnings: Stock can gap up 5-30%

- Negative earnings: Stock can gap down 5-30%

- Beat estimates: Potential 10-20% move

- Miss estimates: Potential 10-30% move



Gap risk explained:

- Trading stops at 4:00 PM Friday

- Earnings release: After market close 4:30 PM

- Overnight: 17 hours with no ability to trade

- Market open 9:30 AM: First chance to sell/buy

- Gap: Jump from Friday close to next open

- Example: Friday close $100, Friday earnings miss

- Monday open: $85 (-15%) due to gap



Why gaps hurt:

- Your stop loss might be $95

- Gap opens at $85, bypasses your stop

- You exit at $85 instead of $95

- Loss: Additional $500 (10 shares × $10)

- Broker cannot fill your stop at $95 (market closed!)



Implied move calculation:

- At-the-money (ATM) options price the expected move

- High implied volatility = Large expected move

- Options 10% away = Market expects 10% move possible

- If IV on 50 call = 15%, market expects ~15% move

</code></pre>
<h2>Managing Positions Through Earnings</h2>
<h3>Strategy 1: Exit Before Earnings</h3>
<p><strong>Safest approach - eliminate binary risk:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: Long AAPL swing trade

Entry: $180 (cost $9,000 for 50 shares)

Current: $185 (+$250 profit)

Earnings date: Thursday after market close



Management plan:

- Monday-Wednesday: Hold position, let it work

- Wednesday close: Position now at $187 (+$350 profit)

- Decision: Exit before earnings risk

- Execute: Sell 50 shares at $187.00

- Profit taken: +$350 (3.9% return)

- Avoid risk: Don&#39;t hold through Thursday earnings



Outcome comparison:



Scenario A: Exit Wednesday (+$350):

- Safe: Locked in profit

- Regret risk: If AAPL rallies 10% Friday

  - Would have been +$1,200 profit

  - But took only +$350 (missed upside)



Scenario B: Hold through earnings:

- Upside risk: +10% = +$1,200 profit (GREAT!)

- Downside risk: -15% gap = -$1,350 loss (TERRIBLE!)

- Risk-reward: Not favorable (potential loss &gt; gain)



Decision:

- Exit if profit already captured (lock it in)

- Hold if target not reached (need to run)

- Exit if stop loss too close to earnings (gap risk high)



Rule of thumb:

- Profit reached: EXIT (lock gains before binary event)

- Target not reached: HEDGE or EXIT (don&#39;t want to risk profit)

- Loss position: EXIT (reduce risk, no reason to hold)

</code></pre>
<h3>Strategy 2: Hedge With Protective Put</h3>
<p><strong>Keep position but buy insurance:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: Long 100 MSFT at $350 (cost $35,000)

Current: $365 (+$1,500 profit)

Earnings: Monday after close



Hedge setup:

- Buy put option at $355 strike

- Cost: $1.50 per share = $150 total (0.43% of position)

- Protection: Limits loss below $355

- Expiration: Tuesday (after earnings)



Outcome scenarios:



Scenario A: Positive earnings, gap to $380

- Stock at $380 (+$3,000 gain)

- Put expires worthless (-$150 loss)

- Net: +$2,850 profit (7.6% on $35K)



Scenario B: Negative earnings, gap to $330

- Stock at $330 (-$2,000 loss)

- Put worth $2,500 (protection at $355)

- Net: -$1,500 + $2,500 put = +$500 profit!

- Insurance worked perfectly



Scenario C: Neutral earnings, close at $360

- Stock at $360 (+$500 gain)

- Put expires worthless (-$150)

- Net: +$350 profit (0.9% on $35K)



Cost of insurance:

- Put premium: $150 (0.43% cost)

- Worth it if: Potential loss &gt; insurance cost

- If lose 10% = $3,500 loss vs. $150 insurance cost

- Insurance ROI: 23:1 (excellent risk-reward)



When to use puts:

- Position very large (20%+ of portfolio)

- Earnings surprise likely (bad history?)

- Can&#39;t stomach 10%+ gap loss

- Want to hold position despite earnings

</code></pre>
<h3>Strategy 3: Reduce Position Size</h3>
<p><strong>Take partial profits, reduce risk:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: Long 100 AAPL at $100 (cost $10,000)

Current: $110 (+10% = +$1,000 profit)

Earnings: Wednesday after market close

Time holding: 2 weeks



Decision: Reduce before earnings risk



Partial exit:

- Sell 50 shares at $110 = $5,500 proceeds

- Lock in: +$500 profit (50 shares × $10)

- Remaining: 50 shares at cost basis $100

- New risk: Only $5,000 at risk



New position structure:

- 50 shares still working for more upside

- Already profitable $500 (captured some gains)

- Reduced risk: Only 50 shares now exposed to gap



Gap scenarios now:



Positive earnings (+10% = $121):

- Remaining 50 shares: +$1,050 profit

- Total profit: +$500 (locked) + $1,050 (remaining) = +$1,550

- Total return: +15.5% on original $10,000



Negative earnings (-15% = $85):

- Remaining 50 shares: -$750 loss

- Total: +$500 (locked) - $750 (remaining) = -$250 loss

- Total return: -2.5% on original $10,000

- Much better than -$1,500 total loss!



Benefits:

- Locked in some profit ($500)

- Still participate in upside (50 shares remaining)

- Reduced downside risk (only 50 shares at risk)

- Psychological comfort (already won something)

</code></pre>
<h3>Strategy 4: Straddle Position</h3>
<p><strong>Play the move either direction:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Position: Uncertain direction after earnings

Want to profit: Whether stock goes up OR down

Setup: Buy both call and put option



Example: TSLA earnings Thursday

Current stock: $850

IV rank: 85th percentile (high implied volatility)

Expected move: ±8% ($68 either direction)



Buy straddle:

- Buy $850 call = $5.00 cost

- Buy $850 put = $4.50 cost

- Total cost: $9.50 per share × 100 = $950

- Breakeven up: $850 + $9.50 = $859.50

- Breakeven down: $850 - $9.50 = $840.50



Outcome scenarios:



Positive earnings, gap to $920:

- Call profit: $920 - $850 = $70

- Put loss: -$4.50

- Net: +$70 - $4.50 = +$65.50

- Profit: +$6,550 (690% on $950 cost!)



Negative earnings, gap to $780:

- Call loss: -$5.00

- Put profit: $850 - $780 = $70

- Net: $70 - $5.00 = +$65.00

- Profit: +$6,500 (684% on $950 cost!)



Sideways earnings, close at $850:

- Both expire worthless

- Loss: -$950 (100% loss)



Risk-Reward:

- Max loss: $950 (both options expire worthless)

- Max profit: Unlimited if stock moves 10%+ either way

- Cost: 1.1% of stock price ($950 on $85,000 position)



When to use:

- High IV (expensive, rewards movement)

- Large expected move (more than straddle cost)

- Earnings shock likely (up or down)

- Don&#39;t care about direction, just want movement



Warning:

- Options trading for beginners is risky

- Save straddles for later experience

- Start with simple strategies (exit/reduce)

</code></pre>
<h2>Post-Earnings Position Management</h2>
<h3>Managing the Gap Open</h3>
<pre><code>
Scenario: AAPL reported earnings, gapped down overnight

- Friday close: $190

- Earnings: Missed expectations (bad news)

- Monday pre-market: $168 (-11.6% gap)



Your position:

- Own 50 shares at $190 entry (cost $9,500)

- Stop loss was $185 (never triggered overnight)

- Gap open: $168 (well below stop)

- Current loss: -$1,100 (-11.6%)



Monday morning actions:



Option 1: Panic sell at open

- Pre-market shows $168, click market sell

- Risk: Further gaps down to $165-$167

- Loss: Potentially -12-13%

- NOT RECOMMENDED (reactive, emotion-based)



Option 2: Wait for stabilization

- Let stock find support in first 30 minutes

- Often gaps down 11%, recovers to 8% down

- Sell when it stabilizes, not at worst point

- Better fill: $170-$172 (better than $168)

- Action: Place limit order to sell at $175 (or better)



Option 3: Accept loss, move forward

- Thesis broken by negative earnings

- No reason to hold further

- Market sell to clear position

- Liquidate within first hour

- Move capital to better opportunity

- Lock in loss (-$1,100)

- Accept and rebuild



Option 4: Wait for recovery attempt

- Stock hits bottom at $165 (15% below entry)

- Recovers some through day to $170

- Wait to see if bounces further

- Sell on strength, not at worst price

- This is gambling, not recommended



Recommended:

- Accept reality of bad earnings

- Sell within first 30-60 minutes

- Don&#39;t add to position (averating down)

- Move on and rebuild capital

- Loss is real, but acceptable (-11.6%)

<h2>Non-Earnings News Risk</h2>
<h3>Types of News Events</h3>
<pre><code>
Major news categories affecting stocks:



Company-specific:

- FDA approval (biotech)

- Product launch (tech)

- CEO change (any company)

- Lawsuit/investigation (financial impact)

- Supply chain issues (operational impact)



Sector-wide:

- Interest rate change (affects all rates-sensitive)

- Regulatory change (affects entire sector)

- Commodity price move (affects materials, energy)

- Currency move (affects exporters)



Market-wide:

- FOMC meeting / Fed announcement

- Jobs report / Economic data

- Trade war news

- Geopolitical tensions



Risk levels:

- Minor news: &lt;2% price move expected

- Medium news: 2-5% price move expected

- Major news: 5-15% price move expected

- Crisis: 15%+ price move expected

</code></pre>
<h3>Managing News Risk</h3>
<pre><code>
Light news event (FDA decision Monday):

- Your position: BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STOCK

- Timeframe: Swing trade (3-5 days)

- Entry: 2 days ago at $100, now $102



Decision: Hold through news?

- Upside if approved: +5-10%

- Downside if rejected: -10-15%

- Risk asymmetry: More downside than upside

- Decision: EXIT before news (lock in +$100 profit)



Heavy news event (Fed rate decision Wednesday):

- Your position: Bank stock (interest rate sensitive)

- Timeframe: Longer swing trade (5-14 days)

- Entry: 3 days ago, position +2%



Decision: Hold through Fed?

- Market uncertainty: High (VIX likely to spike)

- Expected move: 2-4% either direction

- Time to target: Still 1-2 weeks needed

- Decision: REDUCE SIZE (hedge), don&#39;t exit

  - Sell 50% position (lock 1% gain)

  - Hold 50% for potential 5%+ move

  - Risk: No longer exposed if Fed negative



Crisis event (Geopolitical shock):

- Your position: General market positions

- Timeframe: Various

- Market impact: 5-15% likely



Decision: Immediate action needed

- Markets may close, reopen lower

- Exit all positions immediately (priority 1)

- Don&#39;t hold through uncertainty

- After calm: Reassess and rebuild

- Better to give back 2% than lose 10%+ on gap

<h2>Managing Position Through Earnings: Case Study</h2>
<h3>Real Example: Netflix Earnings Swing Trade</h3>
<pre><code>
Setup:

- Netflix NFLX trading $400 (cost: 50 shares = $20,000)

- Swing trade setup identified (pullback in uptrend)

- Entry: Friday Jan 15 at $400

- Target: $420 (+5%)

- Stop loss: $380 (-5%)

- Earnings announced: Wednesday Jan 20 after market close



Week 1 (Jan 15-19):

- Mon: $402 (hold, moving up)

- Tue: $408 (hold, approaching target range)

- Wed morning: $412 (decision time!)

- Decision: Exit before earnings risk



Exit decision logic:

- Profit so far: +$600 (3%)

- Target: $420 (+5% = +$1,000)

- Days to earnings: Same day

- Risk: Gap 10% down = -$2,000

- Risk asymmetry: 2:1 against us

- Best decision: LOCK PROFIT



Execution:

- Sell 50 shares NFLX at $412

- Profit taken: +$600 (3% on $20,000)

- Risk eliminated: Zero overnight risk

- Outcome: Mission accomplished



What happened after:

- Wed after-hours earnings: Missed expectations

- Thu pre-market: $365 (down -8.75%)

- Avoided gap down disaster!

- Would have been: -$1,750 loss if still holding



Journal entry:

- Trade profit: +$600

- Hold time: 4 days

- Opportunity cost: Missed upside if rallied after earnings

- Decision quality: EXCELLENT (got paid and eliminated risk)

- Learning: Exit before binary events, don&#39;t gamble
