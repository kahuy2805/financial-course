<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You've opened your brokerage account, researched stocks, and read quotes. Now comes the exciting part: placing your first actual trade. This lesson walks you through the exact steps to buy your first stock, what happens after you click submit, and what to watch for.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 15-20 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completed Lessons 2.1-2.3 (broker selection, account types, reading quotes)</li>
<li>Have a funded brokerage account (cash account recommended for beginners)</li>
<li>Have identified a stock you want to buy</li>
<li>Broker platform access (website or mobile app)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>Before You Place Your First Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-Flight Checklist:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you have money in the account?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Check your account cash balance</p>
<p>   - Most brokers show this prominently</p>
<p>   - You need enough cash for the purchase</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have you researched the company?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Read about the business (not just price)</p>
<p>   - Understand why you're buying</p>
<p>   - Know the risks</p>
<p>   - Don't buy just because price seems low</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you know how many shares to buy?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Don't put all money in one stock</p>
<p>   - Diversify across at least 3-5 stocks if possible</p>
<p>   - Good rule: Don't let one position be more than 10% of portfolio</p>
<p>   - Start small (maybe 5-10 shares) if nervous</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is your account fully funded?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Did your deposit clear?</p>
<p>   - Check your broker's account status</p>
<p>   - Different brokers have different clearing times (1-3 business days for transfers)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What's your goal?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   - Are you buying to hold long-term (5+ years)?</p>
<p>   - Are you testing/learning?</p>
<p>   - Is this part of a larger strategy?</p>
<p>   - Know your timeline</p>
<h3>The Anatomy of a Trade</h3>
<p>Before we walk through steps, understand what happens:</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Click "Buy 10 shares of Apple at market price"</p>
<p><strong>Your Broker:</strong> Takes your order</p>
<p><strong>Your Broker's System:</strong> Routes to NYSE/NASDAQ exchange</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange:</strong> Matches your buyer order with someone's seller order</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Confirmation - you own 10 shares, they own your cash</p>
<p>This entire process takes seconds.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step: Placing Your First Trade</h3>
<p>#### Step 1: Navigate to the Trading Screen</p>
<p>On your broker's platform (website or app):</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for "Trade" or "Buy" button</li>
<li>Some brokers have "Order Entry" or "Trading Dashboard"</li>
<li>Mobile apps usually have a "+" or "Buy" icon</li>
<li>You should be logged into your account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you'll see:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A search box or field asking for ticker symbol</li>
<li>Price information</li>
<li>Fields for number of shares</li>
<li>Order type options (we'll focus on "Market" order for first trade)</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Step 2: Enter the Ticker Symbol</p>
<p>Type the company's ticker symbol. Use exactly correct spelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>AAPL (not APPLE or AAPPL)</li>
<li>MSFT (not MICROSOFT or MICRO)</li>
<li>GOOGL (not GOOGLE or GOOG)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The platform will usually autocomplete or show suggestions. Use these to verify you have the right company.</p>
<p><strong>Verification Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>System shows company name: "Apple Inc."</li>
<li>Confirms you're trading the right ticker</li>
<li>Shows current bid/ask prices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Beginner Mistake:</strong></p>
<p>Some stocks have similar tickers:</p>
<ul>
<li>GOOG = Google Class C (most common)</li>
<li>GOOGL = Google Class A (different voting rights, same company)</li>
<li>Verify you want the right one</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Step 3: Choose Order Type</p>
<p>For your FIRST trade, choose <strong>"Market Order"</strong> (most straightforward).</p>
<p>Order type options you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market (we'll use this for first trade)</li>
<li>Limit (we'll cover in next lesson)</li>
<li>Stop (we'll cover in next lesson)</li>
<li>Other advanced types</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Order Simply Means:</strong></p>
<p>"Buy this stock at whatever the current market price is, immediately."</p>
<p>Advantages: Guaranteed to fill (you'll definitely get the stock)</p>
<p>Disadvantage: Exact price unknown until trade executes</p>
<p>We'll cover alternatives next lesson. For now, choose Market.</p>
<p>#### Step 4: Enter Quantity</p>
<p>Enter the number of shares you want to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $100? Buy 10 shares</li>
<li>Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $200? Buy 5 shares</li>
<li>Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $50? Buy 20 shares</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quantity Math:</strong></p>
<p>Number of shares = Money to invest ÷ Stock price</p>
<p><strong>Input Field:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type the number (e.g., 10)</li>
<li>Some brokers show running total cost (nice feature)</li>
<li>Others show: "10 shares × $195.48 = $1,954.80"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fractional Shares (Newer Feature):</strong></p>
<p>Many brokers now support fractional shares:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can buy $100 worth even if stock costs $195</li>
<li>System automatically buys 0.512 shares</li>
<li>Very useful for expensive stocks</li>
<li>Gives you flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quantity Decision:</strong></p>
<p>For your FIRST trade, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a small amount (doesn't need to be much)</li>
<li>Maybe 5-10 shares or $100-500 investment</li>
<li>Learning is more important than profits</li>
<li>Once confident, you can add more</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Step 5: Review the Order Summary</p>
<p>Before submitting, the platform shows:</p>
<pre><code>
ORDER SUMMARY

─────────────────────

Stock: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Order Type: Market

Quantity: 10 shares

Current Price: $195.48

Estimated Total: $1,954.80

Cash Available: $2,500.00

Cash After Trade: $545.20

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Check These Critical Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Right ticker? (AAPL)</li>
<li>[ ] Right quantity? (10 shares)</li>
<li>[ ] Right order type? (Market)</li>
<li>[ ] Do you have enough cash? ($1,954.80 available? Yes)</li>
<li>[ ] Is the estimated cost acceptable to you?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red Flag Moments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If estimated cost is more than you expected (multiply shares × price to verify)</li>
<li>If you don't have enough cash</li>
<li>If you ordered wrong number of shares</li>
<li>If ticker is wrong company</li>
<li>Stop and fix it!</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Step 6: Confirm and Submit</p>
<p>Look for "Submit Order," "Buy," "Confirm," or "Place Order" button.</p>
<p>Click it.</p>
<p>You'll likely get a warning: "Confirm: You are about to buy 10 shares of Apple for approximately $1,954.80. Your order will be submitted to the market immediately. Continue?"</p>
<p><strong>This is the safety confirmation.</strong> It exists so you don't accidentally place a huge order.</p>
<p><strong>Click "Confirm" only if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You've verified all details above</li>
<li>You're ready to own this stock</li>
<li>You're comfortable with the investment</li>
<li>You understand you can't cancel immediately once submitted</li>
</ul>
<p>(Actually, you can cancel in the next minute or so, but not after order fills.)</p>
<p>#### Step 7: Get Your Confirmation</p>
<p>Within seconds, you'll see:</p>
<pre><code>
ORDER CONFIRMED ✓

─────────────────────

Order Number: 12345678

Status: FILLED

Execution Time: 2:47 PM ET



Details:

Ticker: AAPL

Quantity: 10 shares

Price: $195.53 (actual execution price)

Total: $1,955.30

Commission: $0.00

</code></pre>
<p><strong>What "Filled" Means:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your order executed successfully</li>
<li>You now own 10 shares of Apple</li>
<li>The cash was deducted from your account</li>
<li>The shares were added to your holdings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Price Might Be Slightly Different:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You saw bid/ask of $195.47 - $195.48</li>
<li>Filled at $195.53</li>
<li>The milliseconds between order and execution, prices might change</li>
<li>This is normal (usually just cents difference)</li>
<li>This is one reason to use limit orders (next lesson)</li>
</ul>
<h3>After Your First Trade</h3>
<p>#### What Happens Next?</p>
<p><strong>Immediately (within seconds):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Order shows in "My Orders" or "Order History"</li>
<li>Your cash balance decreases by purchase amount</li>
<li>Your holdings now show "10 shares AAPL"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Within seconds/minutes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The trade settles (officially completes)</li>
<li>Your broker confirms you own the shares</li>
<li>Most US stock trades settle "T+2" (2 business days) officially</li>
<li>But you own them immediately in your account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Account View:</strong></p>
<p>You'll see something like:</p>
<pre><code>
MY HOLDINGS

</code></pre>
<p>#### Watching Your Trade</p>
<p><strong>Good News:</strong> You don't need to do anything now.</p>
<p><strong>Bad News:</strong> You might be tempted to watch the price constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> The stock will go up and down. This is normal.</p>
<p><strong>What NOT to do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't panic if it drops 2% in an hour</li>
<li>Don't immediately sell at a loss because you're nervous</li>
<li>Don't obsess over intraday price movements</li>
<li>Don't rush to add more or cut losses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What TO do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let it sit for a few days/weeks</li>
<li>Keep monitoring business news</li>
<li>If something fundamentally changed, reassess</li>
<li>If still confident in company, ignore price swings</li>
<li>Add more slowly if you want more exposure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Taxes on Your Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Your first trade creates a tax event.</p>
<p><strong>If You Held 0 Days (Sold Same Day):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Called "day trading"</li>
<li>Profits taxed as short-term capital gains (up to 37% tax rate)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If You Held 1-365 Days (Sold Within a Year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Called "short-term capital gains"</li>
<li>Taxed as ordinary income (15%-37% depending on income)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If You Held 365+ Days (Sold After a Year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Called "long-term capital gains"</li>
<li>Better tax rate (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income)</li>
<li>Much more tax-efficient</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You buy 10 shares at $195.53 = $1,955.30</li>
<li>1 month later, price is $210, you sell = $2,100</li>
<li>Profit: $144.70</li>
<li>Tax (assuming 22% short-term rate): $31.83</li>
<li>Your net gain: $112.87</li>
</ul>
<p>---if you held for 1 year and got long-term rates (15%):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax: $21.71</li>
<li>Your net gain: $122.99</li>
<li>You keep $11 more just from waiting!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Your First Trade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry about taxes yet</li>
<li>Just understand holding longer is better (tax-wise)</li>
<li>You'll handle taxes when selling (or at year-end filing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emotional Response to Your First Trade</h3>
<p><strong>This is normal:</strong> You might feel excited, nervous, or anxious.</p>
<p><strong>Common feelings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Did I make a mistake?"</li>
<li>"What if the price drops tomorrow?"</li>
<li>"I wish I could buy more!"</li>
<li>"I should sell before it drops!"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These feelings are NORMAL.</strong> Even experienced investors feel them.</p>
<p><strong>How to handle them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember you researched this (you didn't pick randomly)</li>
<li>A $100 position isn't going to make or break you</li>
<li>Stock price moves every second - ignore daily noise</li>
<li>If fundamentals don't change, company value hasn't changed</li>
<li>First trade is about learning, not making money</li>
</ul>
<h3>If Something Goes Wrong</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Order Didn't Fill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Market orders almost always fill immediately</li>
<li>If market closes after hours, order might wait for market open</li>
<li>Check order status in "Order History"</li>
<li>If says "Open" or "Pending," it will fill when market opens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Price Changed More Than Expected</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Market volatility happens</li>
<li>Especially around earnings, news, or market-wide events</li>
<li>Don't panic</li>
<li>This is why limit orders exist (next lesson)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Not Enough Cash</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Platform should prevent this (won't let you order)</li>
<li>If balance is tight, might be pending deposits</li>
<li>Check "cash available" vs "cash pending"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 4: Wrong Stock Purchased</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If caught immediately, you might cancel the order</li>
<li>If already filled, you can immediately sell</li>
<li>No major problem, just lesson learned</li>
<li>Verify ticker VERY carefully next time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 5: Broker Is Down or App Crashes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before you order, test the platform</li>
<li>Try on paper trading first</li>
<li>Have backup access method (web or mobile)</li>
<li>If real issue, contact support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Maria's First Trade</h3>
<p>Maria has $2,000 to invest. She's been researching Netflix (NFLX).</p>
<p><strong>Her thought process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"I like Netflix, use the service, believe in the company"</li>
<li>"Netflix stock is around $210/share"</li>
<li>"I have $2,000, so I could buy about 9 shares"</li>
<li>"But I should diversify - what about other stocks?"</li>
<li>"I'll start small - buy 5 shares of Netflix ($1,050)"</li>
<li>"Save $950 for other stocks as I learn"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Her trade:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Opens Fidelity (her broker)</li>
<li>Clicks "Buy"</li>
<li>Enters "NFLX"</li>
<li>Selects "Market Order"</li>
<li>Enters "5" shares</li>
<li>Reviews order: 5 shares × $210.15 = $1,050.75</li>
<li>Clicks "Confirm"</li>
<li>Gets confirmation: Order filled at $210.18 per share</li>
<li>Total cost: $1,050.90</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>After trade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maria now owns 5 shares of Netflix</li>
<li>She has $949.10 left in cash</li>
<li>Netflix price fluctuates</li>
<li>One week later, it's at $208 (down $10/share = $50 loss on her position)</li>
<li>She doesn't panic - she still believes in Netflix</li>
<li>Plans to add more shares over time if price stays reasonable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roberto's Learning Approach</h3>
<p>Roberto starts with $500. He's never invested before.</p>
<p><strong>His approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"I'll make a tiny first trade just to learn the process"</li>
<li>"I don't want risk or complexity yet"</li>
<li>"I'll buy 1 share of an index ETF (SPY) at $450"</li>
<li>Executes the trade</li>
<li>Observes for 2 weeks - sees platform works fine, understands fees ($0)</li>
<li>Now confident, researches individual stocks</li>
<li>Makes his second trade buying 5 shares of a company he researched</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roberto got comfortable with the platform first</li>
<li>Low stakes (1 share is small investment)</li>
<li>Proved to himself he could execute a trade</li>
<li>Built confidence before larger positions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Not Verifying the Ticker</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> It's easy to order wrong stock, especially if they have similar tickers. Double-check the company name, not just ticker.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Using Market Order During High Volatility</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> In fast-moving markets, market order might fill at very different price than you expected. Use limit orders in volatile conditions (next lesson).</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Buying During After-Hours Trading</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many brokers allow after-hours trading, but with worse prices and lower liquidity. Avoid for first trades. Trade during regular market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET).</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Panic Selling After First Drop</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> All stocks drop sometimes. A 5% drop in a day is normal market behavior, not a disaster. Don't sell just because of price movement.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: All-in First Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Don't invest your entire account in one stock. Start small, learn, then gradually add positions.</p>
<h3>Mistake #6: Not Keeping Trade Records</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> You'll need this for taxes. Screenshot or write down: stock bought, date, number of shares, price. Your broker keeps records, but having personal records helps.</p>
<h3>Mistake #7: Thinking First Trade = Get Rich Quick</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Your first trade is about learning to execute, not making profits. Profits come from good decisions over time, not lucky first picks.</p>

<h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Paper Trading (Risk-Free Practice)</h3>
<p><strong>Before using real money, practice with "paper trading":</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Most brokers offer free paper trading</li>
<li>Your broker's website should have a "Practice Trading" or "Paper Trading" section</li>
<li>Practice placing 3 trades:</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Buy 10 shares of AAPL</p>
<p>   - Buy 5 shares of MSFT</p>
<p>   - Buy 8 shares of GOOGL</p>
<ol>
<li>Get comfortable with the interface</li>
<li>Understand exactly where each button is</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 2: Plan Your First Real Trade</h3>
<p>Write down:</p>
<ol>
<li>What stock will you buy? (ticker)</li>
<li>How many shares? (or dollar amount)</li>
<li>Why are you buying this stock? (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>How long will you hold it? (timeframe)</li>
<li>What could make you sell it? (conditions)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 3: Verification Checklist</h3>
<p>Create a checklist you'll use before every trade:</p>
