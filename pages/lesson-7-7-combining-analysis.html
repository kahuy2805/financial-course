<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The most successful traders don't rely on technical analysis alone or fundamental analysis alone. They use both strategically. Technical analysis tells you WHEN to trade, while fundamental analysis tells you WHAT to trade and WHY. Master the combination and you'll have a complete trading system.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 25-30 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completion of all Chapters 6 and 7 lessons</li>
<li>Understanding of both technical and fundamental approaches</li>
<li>Ability to interpret charts and financial statements</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>Why Combine Both?</h3>
<p><strong>Technical Analysis Alone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages: Catches trends early, precise entries, quick profits</li>
<li>Disadvantages: No idea if stock will crash on bad earnings, no valuation sense</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fundamental Analysis Alone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages: Identifies true value, protects from overpaying</li>
<li>Disadvantages: Slow (market lags news), no idea when to enter, early by months/years</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combined Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages: Best of both worlds - know what to buy, when to buy, confidence in thesis</li>
<li>Superior risk-adjusted returns, fewer surprises</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: The Power of Combining</strong></p>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ONLY:</strong><br>
  - Price broke above 200-day MA<br>
  - 50-day EMA crossing above 200-day SMA (Golden Cross)<br>
  - RSI bouncing from 35 (oversold)<br>
  - Signal: BUY<br>
  - Risk: Stock could be expensive, or bad earnings could crash it
</div>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS ONLY:</strong><br>
  - P/E ratio: 25 (fair value)<br>
  - ROE: 35% (excellent)<br>
  - Revenue growing 5% (slow growth)<br>
  - Signal: BUY if price comes down 10%<br>
  - Risk: Miss the move while waiting for pullback
</div>
<div class="example-block">
  <strong>COMBINED APPROACH:</strong><br>
  - Fundamentals: Stock is fairly valued, quality business ✓<br>
  - Technicals: Just broke above major resistance, good setup ✓<br>
  - Decision: BUY NOW (technical setup + good valuation + quality)<br>
  - Risk: Minimized because both confirm
</div>
<p>Result: Caught the move up 15% with confidence</p>
<h3>The Four-Part Trading Decision</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1: Fundamental Thesis (WHAT to Trade)</strong></p>
<p>Answer: "Why do I want to own this stock?"</p>
<p>Examples of valid theses:</p>
<pre><code>
Thesis A: Apple growing services revenue 20%+ (high-margin)

Thesis B: Tesla dominates EV market with improving margins

Thesis C: Microsoft cloud business growing 25%+ annually

Thesis D: Financial stocks cheap at P/E 8 with 4% dividend

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 2: Valuation Check (Is It Cheap?)</strong></p>
<p>Answer: "Is the stock price reasonable relative to value?"</p>
<pre><code>
Method 1: Compare P/E to industry

- Industry average: 18

- This stock: 22

- Verdict: Slight premium, but if growth justifies it, OK



Method 2: Compare to historical

- Historical P/E: 20 average

- Current P/E: 25

- Verdict: Expensive relative to history, wait



Method 3: Check free cash flow

- Is FCF growing with revenue?

- Is FCF positive?

- Verdict: Is profit real or accounting fiction?

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 3: Technical Setup (WHEN to Buy)</strong></p>
<p>Answer: "Is the technical setup good for entry?"</p>
<pre><code>
Setup 1: Value + Bounce from Support

- Fundamentals say buy (cheap, good business)

- Technical setup: Price pulled back to 50-day EMA

- Entry: Buy at 50-day EMA support



Setup 2: Breakout on Technicals

- Fundamentals confirm quality

- Technical setup: Price breaking above resistance

- Entry: Buy the breakout (supply dries up)



Setup 3: Golden Cross + Good Fundamentals

- Fundamentals confirm business strength

- Technical setup: 50-EMA crosses above 200-day SMA

- Entry: Buy the golden cross

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 4: Risk Management (Stop Loss)</strong></p>
<p>Answer: "Where do I exit if I'm wrong?"</p>
<pre><code>
Rule 1: Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade

Risk = Buy Price - Stop Loss Price



Example:

- Account: $100,000

- Max Risk: $1,000 (1% of account)

- Buy Price: $100

- Max Stop Loss: $90 (2% below)

- Position Size: $1,000 ÷ $10 = 100 shares



Rule 2: Stop Loss Placement

- Below technical support (moving average, support level)

- Don&#39;t place it on emotions

- Don&#39;t move it once placed (unless scaling in)

</code></pre>
<h3>The Complete Trading System</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Screen for Good Fundamentals</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Criteria:

✓ Revenue growing 5%+ YoY (or high quality if mature)

✓ Profit margins stable or expanding

✓ Free cash flow positive and growing

✓ Debt reasonable (D/E &lt; 2.0 for most)

✓ ROE above 10% (preferably 15%+)

✓ P/E reasonable relative to growth (PEG &lt; 2.0)



Result: List of 10-15 quality candidates

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Evaluate Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Check:

- Is the industry growing or declining?

- Are there tailwinds (new demand) or headwinds (competition)?

- Can the company outperform the sector?



Example:

- Retail sector declining overall

- But Costco growing faster than sector (quality discounter)

- Result: Still a good pick despite sector weakness

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Technical Analysis for Entry</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Pull up daily chart:

- Price above or below 50-day EMA? (Is it in uptrend?)

- Is there a good support level for entry? (MA, trendline, Fib)

- Is the momentum good? (MACD, RSI, volume)

- Any chart patterns forming? (Flag, consolidation)



Decision:

- Buy immediately if price pulls back to good support

- Or wait for breakout if resistance clear

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: Set Risk/Reward and Position Size</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Example Setup:

- Buy: $100

- Stop Loss: $95 (Risk: $5)

- Target: $110 (Reward: $10)

- Risk/Reward: 1:2 (good setup)



Position Size:

- Account: $100,000

- Max Risk: $1,000 (1% per trade)

- Position Size: $1,000 ÷ $5 = 200 shares

- Entry Capital: 200 × $100 = $20,000 (20% of account)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5: Execute and Monitor</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Entry:

- Buy at planned level

- Place stop loss immediately

- Place target order or set alert



Monitoring:

- Track fundamental thesis (earnings, growth)

- Monitor technical support levels

- Watch for any breakdown of thesis

- Manage position (take partial profits at targets)



Exit:

- Stop loss if thesis breaks

- Or take profits at target

- Or hold if business getting better (reassess)

</code></pre>
<h3>Real-World Complete Example</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: Trading Microsoft Bounce</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Fundamental Thesis</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Microsoft positive thesis:

- Cloud business (Azure) growing 25%+ YoY

- AI integration increasing market (Copilot)

- Free cash flow $60B+ annually

- Dividend growing

- Strong balance sheet



Conclusion: Good business, long-term compounder

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 2: Valuation Check</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Metrics:

- P/E: 28 (vs. tech sector average 22)

- PEG Ratio: 1.2 (growth justifies premium)

- P/B: 10 (normal for high-ROE tech)



Conclusion: Fairly valued, not cheap but not expensive

Premium justified by growth rate

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 3: Technical Setup</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Daily Chart Analysis:

- Price: $380

- 50-day EMA: $375 (price above it, uptrend in place)

- 200-day SMA: $370 (price above it, long-term uptrend)

- Recent support: $365 (previous swing low)



Technical Setup:

- Pullback to 50-day EMA = Good entry point

- Small dip on heavy volume = Capitulation

- Reversal candlestick forming = Bounce coming



Conclusion: If price pulls back to $375-376, excellent entry

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Part 4: Risk Management</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Entry Plan:

- Entry: $375 (at 50-day EMA)

- Stop Loss: $365 (below support)

- Risk: $10 per share

- Account Risk: $1,000 (1% max)

- Position Size: $1,000 ÷ $10 = 100 shares

- Capital Used: 100 × $375 = $37,500



Target Plan:

- First Target: $390 (near-term resistance)

- Second Target: $405 (higher resistance)

- Sell Strategy: Half at $390, half at $405 (scale out)

- Or hold if fundamentals accelerating (let winners run)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Trade Execution</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Day 1: Technical setup appears

- Price drops to $374 (better entry!)

- Volume increases 3x normal

- BUY 100 shares at $374

- Place stop at $363

- Place target at $390



Day 2-3: Price bounces

- Bounces to $385

- Sell 50 shares at $390 (profit $8 per share, $400 profit)

- Move stop to breakeven ($374)



Day 4-10: Continued move

- Price breaks above $400

- Sell remaining 50 at $405

- Total profit: (50 × $8) + (50 × $31) = $400 + $1,550 = $1,950

- Return: $1,950 ÷ $37,500 = 5.2% on capital in 2 weeks

- Annual: 135%+ (but one lucky trade)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why This System Works</strong></p>
<pre><code>
✓ Fundamental thesis = Know why you&#39;re buying

✓ Valuation check = Don&#39;t overpay

✓ Technical setup = Buy at best time

✓ Risk management = Protect capital

✓ Position sizing = Never risk too much

✓ Scale out = Lock in profits gradually

Result: Consistent, lower-risk profitable trading

</code></pre>
<h3>When Technical and Fundamental Disagree</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: Situation Where They Conflict</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Situation: Great Company, Bad Technical Setup



Fundamental:

- Incredible earnings report

- Guidance raised 20%

- Stock is cheap



Technical:

- Stock broke below 200-day MA

- MACD turned negative

- Big support broken



What to do?

Option A: Trust fundamentals, buy on dip (RISKY)

  - Stock might fall 20% more before bouncing

  - You&#39;ll have large drawdown even if right long-term

  - Position sizing essential



Option B: Wait for technical recovery (SAFER)

  - Wait for price to bounce back above 200-day MA

  - Wait for MACD to turn positive again

  - Buy the technical recovery (safer entry)



BEST APPROACH:

- Respect the technical break

- Scale in gradually:

  * Buy small on initial dip (1/3 position)

  * Buy more on 50-day MA bounce (1/3 position)

  * Buy final portion on 200-day MA recovery (1/3 position)

- This reduces drawdown risk while building position

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Opposite Scenario: Great Technical Setup, Bad Fundamental</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Situation: Stock Breaking Out, But Earnings Disappointing



Technical:

- Stock breaking above resistance

- Volume increasing

- Chart looks great



Fundamental:

- Revenue declining

- Profit margins compressed

- Debt increasing



What to do?

Option A: Trade the technical breakout (HIGH RISK)

  - Stock might crash on next earnings

  - Breakout could fail

  - Not recommended



Option B: Avoid the trade completely (SAFEST)

  - Don&#39;t fight fundamental problems

  - No amount of good technical setup is worth bad fundamentals

  - Find stocks with both working



LESSON:

- Good technicals + Bad fundamentals = AVOID

- Technical breakout often fails if business struggling

- Best trades have BOTH fundamentals and technicals aligned

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Over-Relying on Fundamentals</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Stock is fundamentally great, so you buy without good technical setup. Price falls 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Even great companies fall in price. Wait for good technical setup.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Technical Setup Overrides Everything</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Chart looks great, so you buy. Earnings disaster next week. Stock crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always check fundamental calendar before trade. Avoid earnings surprises.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Holding Through Fundamental Breaks</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You have thesis, but company just cut guidance. You keep holding anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> If fundamental thesis breaks (earnings miss, guidance cut), exit position. Adjust and reassess.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Scaling Into Bad Positions</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Stock is falling, so you buy more to "average down" hoping for recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> If thesis still valid, average down is OK. But if thesis broken, just take the loss.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Not Adjusting Stop Loss With Time</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Bought at $100, stop at $90. Stock at $95 six months later. Still holding.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> If time horizon changes or fundamental thesis changes, reassess stop loss. Don't be stubborn.</p>
