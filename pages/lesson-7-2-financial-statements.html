<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Financial statements are the language companies use to communicate their financial health. Learn to read them and you'll have access to the same information professional investors use. In this lesson, you'll master the three essential financial statements and understand what each one reveals.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 30-35 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completion of Lesson 7.1: Introduction to Fundamental Analysis</li>
<li>Basic accounting knowledge (assets, liabilities, income)</li>
<li>Ability to understand simple financial calculations</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>The Three Financial Statements</h3>
<p>Every publicly traded company publishes three statements quarterly and annually:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Income Statement</strong> - Profit and Loss</li>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong> - Assets and Liabilities</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> - Cash Movement</li>
</ol>
<h3>Statement 1: Income Statement (P&L)</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> Revenue, expenses, and profit over a period (quarter or year).</p>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Revenue (top line)

- Cost of Goods Sold

= Gross Profit

- Operating Expenses

= Operating Income

- Interest Expense

= Income Before Taxes

- Taxes

= Net Income (bottom line)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple Income Statement (Fiscal 2023)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Total Net Sales (Revenue):                 $383,285 million

Cost of Sales:                             $214,137 million

                                           ─────────────────

Gross Profit:                              $169,148 million

                                           (44.1% margin)



Operating Expenses:

  Research &amp; Development:   $29,915M

  SG&amp;A (Selling, General):  $26,291M

  Total Operating Exp:      $56,206 million

                                           ─────────────────

Operating Income:                          $112,942 million

                                           (29.4% margin)



Other income/expense:                      $10,045 million

Income before taxes:                       $122,987 million

Provision for income taxes:                $23,601 million

                                           ─────────────────

Net Income:                                $99,386 million

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Revenue Growth</strong></td>
            <td>Is company selling more?</td>
            <td>5-15% yearly growth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Gross Margin</strong></td>
            <td>Profit before operating costs</td>
            <td>30-50% for healthy companies</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Operating Margin</strong></td>
            <td>Profit after operating costs</td>
            <td>10-30% for healthy companies</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Net Margin</strong></td>
            <td>Final profit after all costs</td>
            <td>5-20% for healthy companies</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Real Example: Comparing Margins</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Apple:

- Net Income: $99.4B on Revenue $383.3B

- Net Margin: 99.4 ÷ 383.3 = 25.9%

- Interpretation: For every $1 of sales, keep $0.26 profit



Walmart:

- Net Income: $15.5B on Revenue $611.3B

- Net Margin: 15.5 ÷ 611.3 = 2.5%

- Interpretation: For every $1 of sales, keep $0.025 profit



Why the difference?

- Apple: High-margin tech/services (sells $1000 phones)

- Walmart: Low-margin retail (sells $5 items with small markup)



Both can be excellent businesses, just different models

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reading the Income Statement:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Is revenue growing?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year 1 Revenue: $100M

Year 2 Revenue: $110M (10% growth) ✓ GOOD

Year 3 Revenue: $115M (4.5% growth) ✗ SLOWING

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 2: Are expenses growing slower than revenue?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Revenue grew 10%, but expenses grew 15% = Margin compression

This means profits are shrinking even though sales are growing (PROBLEM)



Revenue grew 10%, expenses grew 5% = Margin expansion

This means profits are growing faster than sales (EXCELLENT)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 3: What's the trend in profit?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year 1 Net Income: $10M

Year 2 Net Income: $12M (20% growth) ✓ GOOD

Year 3 Net Income: $11M (8% decline) ✗ WARNING

</code></pre>
<h3>Statement 2: Balance Sheet</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> What the company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time.</p>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Shareholders&#39; Equity



This always balances (that&#39;s why it&#39;s called a balance sheet)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple Balance Sheet (Sept 2023)</strong></p>
<pre><code>
ASSETS:

Current Assets:

  Cash and Cash Equivalents:           $29,965 million

  Other Assets:                        $174,758 million

                                       ──────────────

TOTAL ASSETS:                          $352,180 million

  Other Long-term Liabilities:         $49,848 million

                                       ──────────────

TOTAL LIABILITIES:                     $291,814 million





SHAREHOLDERS&#39; EQUITY:

Common Stock:                          $73,812 million

Retained Earnings:                     ($11,446) million

                                       ──────────────

TOTAL EQUITY:                          $60,366 million

                                       ──────────────

Total Liabilities + Equity:            $352,180 million ✓ Balances!

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Metrics on Balance Sheet:</strong></p>
<p>| Section | What It Means | What You Want |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| <strong>Current Assets</strong> | Cash and things easily convertible to cash | Higher is better |</p>
<p>| <strong>Current Liabilities</strong> | Debts due within 1 year | Lower is better |</p>
<p>| <strong>Long-term Debt</strong> | Loans the company owes | Lower is better (or manageable) |</p>
<p>| <strong>Shareholders' Equity</strong> | Owner's stake (Assets - Liabilities) | Growing over time |</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Financial Strength</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Company A:

- Total Assets: $1000M

- Total Liabilities: $100M

- Shareholders&#39; Equity: $900M

- Debt-to-Equity: 0.11 (very low debt, very safe)

✓ Financially strong



Company B:

- Total Assets: $1000M

- Total Liabilities: $800M

- Shareholders&#39; Equity: $200M

- Debt-to-Equity: 4.0 (very high debt, very risky)

✗ Financially weak



In economic downturns, Company A survives and Company B might go bankrupt

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reading the Balance Sheet:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Does the company have enough cash?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Current Assets: $500M

Current Liabilities: $200M

Working Capital: $300M (excess cash available) ✓ GOOD

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 2: Is debt manageable?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Long-term Debt: $100M

Annual Operating Income: $200M

Debt-to-EBIT ratio: 0.5 (low debt) ✓ GOOD



Long-term Debt: $500M

Annual Operating Income: $200M

Debt-to-EBIT ratio: 2.5 (high debt) ✗ RISKY

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 3: Is equity growing?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year 1 Shareholders&#39; Equity: $500M

Year 2 Shareholders&#39; Equity: $550M (growing) ✓ GOOD

Year 3 Shareholders&#39; Equity: $580M (continuing to grow) ✓ GOOD

</code></pre>
<h3>Statement 3: Cash Flow Statement</h3>
<p><strong>What It Shows:</strong> Where cash came from and where it went during the period.</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong> Profit on the income statement is often not the same as cash in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Profit vs. Cash</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Scenario: Company sells $1000 in products but on credit (customer pays in 90 days)



Income Statement:

- Revenue: $1000 ✓ (revenue recognized immediately)

- Net Income: $500 (profit)



Cash Flow Statement:

- Operating Cash Flow: $0 (customer hasn&#39;t paid yet!)



Difference: Company shows $500 profit but has $0 cash

This is why cash flow matters!

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Operating Cash Flow

  = Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization

    ± Changes in Working Capital

    ± Changes in Payables/Receivables



Free Cash Flow

  = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple Cash Flow Statement</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Operating Activities:

  Net Income:                          $99,386 million

  Adjustments:

    Depreciation &amp; Amortization:       $12,763 million

    Stock-based Compensation:          $8,708 million

  Changes in Working Capital:          ($5,338) million

                                       ─────────────────

Operating Cash Flow:                   $110,543 million



Investing Activities:

  Capital Expenditures:                ($10,949) million

  Purchases of Investments:            ($7,191) million

                                       ─────────────────

Free Cash Flow:                        $99,594 million



Financing Activities:

  Debt Payments:                       ($3,000) million

  Share Buybacks:                      ($73,086) million

  Dividends Paid:                      ($14,841) million

                                       ─────────────────

Net Change in Cash:                    $8,667 million

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Metrics on Cash Flow:</strong></p>
<p>| Metric | What It Means | What You Want |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| <strong>Operating Cash Flow</strong> | Cash generated from business | Growing and positive |</p>
<p>| <strong>Free Cash Flow</strong> | Cash available after investments | Growing and positive |</p>
<p>| <strong>Capital Expenditures</strong> | Money spent on equipment, factories | Should be reasonable % of revenue |</p>
<p>| <strong>Share Buybacks</strong> | Company buying back its own stock | Shows management confidence |</p>
<p><strong>Reading the Cash Flow Statement:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Is the company generating cash?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Operating Cash Flow: $100M

- This is the most important number

- If positive and growing, company is healthy

- If negative, company is burning cash

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 2: How much free cash flow?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Operating Cash Flow: $100M

Capital Expenditures: $20M (needed for growth)

Free Cash Flow: $80M



Free Cash Flow / Revenue = 80/500 = 16%

Good benchmark: 5-15% for healthy companies

This company is at upper end (EXCELLENT)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question 3: What's the company doing with excess cash?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Option A: Paying dividends (returning to shareholders)

Option B: Reinvesting (building factories, R&amp;D)

Option C: Paying down debt (strengthening balance sheet)

Option D: Buybacks (rewarding shareholders)



Best answer: Mix of all four depending on company stage

</code></pre>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
<p><strong>Complete Financial Picture:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
INCOME STATEMENT shows: Is the company profitable?

↓

- If yes, profit is growing?

- If growing, at what rate?

- Are margins expanding or contracting?



BALANCE SHEET shows: Is the company financially strong?

↓

- Does it have cash to survive downturns?

- Is debt at reasonable levels?

- Is equity growing?



CASH FLOW shows: Is profit real or just accounting?

↓

- Converting profit to actual cash?

- Generating free cash flow?

- Sufficient to fund dividends and growth?

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Complete Analysis of Microsoft</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Income Statement (Annual):

✓ Revenue growing 10% ($200B → $220B)

✓ Net Margin stable at 35% (very high)

✓ Profit growing 12% ($65B → $73B)

Signal: HEALTHY, growing, profitable



Balance Sheet:

✓ Cash: $100B+ (very strong)

✓ Debt manageable at $50B

✓ Equity growing 8% annually

Signal: STRONG, financially solid



Cash Flow Statement:

✓ Operating Cash Flow: $75B (excellent)

✓ Free Cash Flow: $60B (excellent)

✓ Pays $20B dividends, does $50B buybacks

Signal: EXCELLENT, generating real cash



Conclusion: Microsoft is:

- Profitable and growing

- Financially strong

- Generating substantial free cash flow

- Returning value to shareholders

Result: Quality company worth paying premium valuation for

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Only Looking at Net Income</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Company has $10M profit, so you think it's good. You don't check if cash flow is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check all three statements. Profit means nothing if cash flow is negative.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring Changes in Working Capital</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Revenue growing fast, but accounts receivable ballooning. Cash isn't coming in fast enough.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compare revenue growth to cash flow growth. Should be roughly aligned.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Confusing GAAP and Non-GAAP</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Company reports two different profit numbers. Not sure which is real.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use GAAP (official) numbers. Non-GAAP often excludes bad items to look better.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Not Adjusting for One-Time Items</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Company had one-time gain on sale of asset. Profits look inflated.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Remove one-time gains/losses to understand recurring profitability.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Ignoring Depreciation and Amortization</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Company has big depreciation, so accounting profit is low. But it's non-cash.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Understand depreciation is non-cash. Add it back to understand true cash generation.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>✓ <strong>Income Statement</strong> = Profitability (Profit = Revenue - Expenses)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> = Financial Strength (Equity = Assets - Liabilities)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Cash Flow</strong> = Real Cash Generation (Different from accounting profit)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Margins</strong> = Percentage profit on each sale (Higher is better)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Working Capital</strong> = Cash available to operate (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Free Cash Flow</strong> = Cash available after investments (Operating CF - CapEx)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>All three matter</strong> = Need all three for complete picture</p>
