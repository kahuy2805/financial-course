                <h1>Lesson 14.6: From Part-Time to Full-Time Trading (If That's the Goal)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The ultimate dream: Quit your job and trade full-time. For some it's achievable. For others it's dangerous fantasy. This lesson shows the realistic requirements, timeline, and path to sustainable full-time trading—if you want it.</p>
<h2>The Full-Time Trading Dream vs. Reality</h2>
<h3>The Fantasy</h3>
<pre><code>
Fantasy Version:

- Quit job day 1

- Trade from home in pajamas

- Make $100,000/year from $10,000 account

- No stress, complete freedom

- Work only when you want

- Retire by 30



Time frame: Year 1 success

</code></pre>
<h3>The Reality</h3>
<pre><code>
Real Version:

- Prove consistent profitability first (1-3 years)

- Build capital to $50,000-100,000+

- Generate $3,000-5,000/month minimum (living expenses)

- Require $10,000-15,000 monthly for comfortable living

- Work 40+ hours/week (market hours + research)

- Deal with loneliness and isolation

- Manage stress and emotional pressure

- No benefits (health insurance, retirement, etc.)

- Variable income (some months great, some months rough)

- Risk of bankruptcy if system fails



Time frame: 5-10 years of part-time + proven system

</code></pre>
<h2>Prerequisites for Full-Time Trading</h2>
<h3>Financial Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>How Much Capital Do You Need?</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Calculation method:

Required Monthly Income ÷ Expected Monthly Return % = Capital Needed



Examples:



Scenario 1: Conservative Income Goal

Monthly living expenses: $3,000

Safe withdrawal rate: 1.5%/month (18%/year)

Capital needed: $3,000 ÷ 0.015 = $200,000



Scenario 2: Comfortable Living

Monthly living expenses: $5,000

Safe withdrawal rate: 1.5%/month

Capital needed: $5,000 ÷ 0.015 = $333,000



Scenario 3: Modest Living

Monthly living expenses: $2,500

Aggressive withdrawal: 2%/month (24%/year)

Capital needed: $2,500 ÷ 0.02 = $125,000



Rule of thumb for USA:

You need $150,000-300,000 capital minimum

Assumes: 1.5-2% monthly income (18-24%/year)

Income target: $3,000-5,000/month minimum



Buffer needed: Keep 6-12 months expenses in cash

Never risk capital below survival level

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Income Requirement Worksheet</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year 1-3 (Transition years):

Keep day job while building trading income



Monthly fixed expenses: $__________

  Rent/mortgage: $__________

  Utilities: $__________

  Insurance: $__________

  Food: $__________

  Transportation: $__________

  Other: $__________



Taxes (estimate): ________% of income



Current job income: $__________/month

Current lifestyle: $__________ of income saved/month



Trading income needed to replace job:

Job salary / 12 = $__________/month

After taxes (40%): $__________ /month needed from trading



Full-time trading minimum threshold: $__________ /month

(This is non-negotiable minimum)



Your capital needed: Minimum income ÷ 0.015 = $__________



Time to reach capital: ______ years at current savings rate

Time to prove system: ______ more years

Total time to full-time: ______ years (realistic)

</code></pre>
<h3>Performance Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Minimum Track Record Before Going Full-Time</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Before quitting job: MANDATORY CHECKLIST



☐ 2+ years of consistent profitability

  Not just 1 lucky year. Two full market cycles.



☐ 100+ documented trades

  Statistical significance requires sample size.

  Need to see patterns over time.



☐ Win rate ≥ 55%

  Profitable traders consistently beat 50%.

  If you can&#39;t hit 55% after 100 trades: System isn&#39;t ready.



☐ Positive return in both bull AND bear markets

  Your system must work in multiple market regimes.

  One good bull year doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll work in recession.



☐ Trading income ≥ 50% of job income

  Before full-time: Prove you can make $X from trading

  While having job income too.



Example:

Job income: $5,000/month

Trading income: $2,500+/month (50% of job)

If you can consistently make $2,500/month from trading

While also working job...

Then you MIGHT be ready for full-time.



☐ Documented system (written trading plan)

  Full-time requires discipline and documentation.

  If you don&#39;t have it, you&#39;re not ready.



☐ Capital ≥ $150,000

  Less than this and you&#39;re undercapitalized.

  One bad month could wipe you out.



☐ 12+ months of living expenses in cash

  Trading income is variable.

  Need safety net for down months.



☐ Emotional stability through losses

  Can you handle -20% draw-down and NOT panic sell?

  Can you handle zero profitable days/weeks?

  If not: You&#39;re not ready emotionally.



☐ Zero dependents (or very supportive partner)

  Trading income supports only you (ideally).

  Family depending on your income = Dangerous risk.

</code></pre>
<h2>Worst-Case Planning: What If It Doesn't Work?</h2>
<h3>The Realistic Failure Scenario</h3>
<pre><code>
Reality: 50% of full-time traders go back to work



Reasons they fail:

1. Income not sustainable (variances too large)

2. Psychological pressure (isolation, losses compound)

3. System breaks in new market regime

4. Discipline eroded by freedom

5. Realized they enjoy employment



Plan B: If it doesn&#39;t work out



First 3 months:

- Give system and yourself 90 days minimum

- Losses are normal, don&#39;t panic

- Adjust if needed, but don&#39;t abandon system



Months 4-6:

- If still losing: Problem is likely real

- If barely breaking even: Maybe works part-time instead

- Create 6-month sustainability plan



Months 7-12:

- Decision point: Continue or find employment

- No shame in going back

- You learned valuable skills



The Backup Plan:

☐ Identify part-time/remote jobs you could return to

☐ Keep resume updated

☐ Maintain professional relationships

☐ Don&#39;t burn bridges at job

☐ Know what unemployment benefits you qualify for

☐ Have Plan B funds saved ($10,000-20,000)



Reality: 50% failure rate is not shameful

It means you tried something difficult

Most people never try

You did, and learned massive value

That&#39;s success even if trading doesn&#39;t work
