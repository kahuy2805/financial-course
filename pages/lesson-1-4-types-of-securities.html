<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>What is a Security?</h3>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Any financial instrument that can be bought and sold and represents value.</p>
<p>Think of it like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency</strong>: Paper money is a "security" - it's tradeable and represents value</li>
<li><strong>Concert tickets</strong>: Can be bought/sold/resold for money</li>
<li><strong>Real estate</strong>: A house is a security - you can buy and sell it</li>
<li><strong>Art</strong>: Paintings are securities - they're traded between collectors</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial context, securities are investments tradeable in markets.</p>
<h3>The Three Main Categories</h3>
<p>Securities fall into three main buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Equity Securities</strong> - Ownership in a company (stocks)</li>
<li><strong>Debt Securities</strong> - Loans you give to companies or governments (bonds)</li>
<li><strong>Derivative Securities</strong> - Contracts based on other securities (options)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's explore each:</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. EQUITY SECURITIES (Ownership)</h2>
<p>You've already learned about stocks, which are equity securities. Let's expand:</p>
<h3>Common Stocks</h3>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<p>Pieces of ownership in a company that give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting rights (in shareholder meetings)</li>
<li>Rights to dividends (if the company distributes profits)</li>
<li>Rights to residual value (if company is liquidated)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>You own 100 shares of Apple out of 15 billion total shares. You own 100/15,000,000,000 = 0.0000007% of Apple. Tiny, but real ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No guaranteed return</li>
<li>Can gain or lose value</li>
<li>Dividends vary by company and year</li>
<li>Higher growth potential than bonds</li>
<li>Higher risk than bonds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preferred Stocks</h3>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<p>A hybrid between stocks and bonds. They have characteristics of both.</p>
<p><strong>How They Differ from Common Stock:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher dividend payments (more predictable)</li>
<li>Dividend paid before common stockholders get paid</li>
<li>Don't usually have voting rights</li>
<li>Less growth potential</li>
<li>Lower risk than common stocks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>A company might issue preferred stock paying 5% dividend yearly. It's almost like a bond but with a fixed value.</p>
<p><strong>Who Buys Them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conservative investors seeking income</li>
<li>Retirement portfolios</li>
<li>Banks and insurance companies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison: Common vs Preferred Stock</h3>
<p>| Aspect | Common Stock | Preferred Stock |</p>
<p>|--------|--------------|-----------------|</p>
<p>| Ownership | Yes | Yes (non-voting usually) |</p>
<p>| Dividends | Variable | Fixed |</p>
<p>| Growth | Higher potential | Lower potential |</p>
<p>| Risk | Higher | Lower |</p>
<p>| When paid | Last | First |</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. DEBT SECURITIES (Bonds)</h2>
<h3>What is a Bond?</h3>
<p>Imagine your friend needs $1,000. Instead of giving it as a gift, you offer a deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'll lend you $1,000"</li>
<li>"You'll pay me $50 interest per year ($1,000 × 5%)"</li>
<li>"In 10 years, you'll return my $1,000"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You've created a bond.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bond Definition</strong>: A loan issued by a company or government. When you buy a bond, you're the lender.</p>
<h3>How Bonds Work</h3>
<p><strong>Bond Components:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Face Value (Par Value):</strong> The amount you'll get back</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually $1,000 per bond</li>
<li>Example: You buy a bond with $1,000 face value</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coupon Rate:</strong> The interest rate you'll receive</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed at issue</li>
<li>Example: 5% coupon rate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maturity Date:</strong> When you get your money back</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 10 years from issue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Payment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You pay $1,000 today</li>
<li>Receive $50 per year ($1,000 × 5%) for 10 years</li>
<li>Get $1,000 back in 10 years</li>
<li>Total received: $1,500 ($50 × 10 years + $1,000 principal)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Bonds</h3>
<p>#### Government Bonds</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Treasury Bonds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury</li>
<li>Backed by U.S. government</li>
<li>Extremely safe (lowest risk)</li>
<li>Lower interest rates (2-5%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>A 10-year Treasury bond pays 4% interest yearly. Very safe, but lower returns than stocks.</p>
<p>#### Corporate Bonds</p>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issued by companies</li>
<li>Backed by the company's ability to pay</li>
<li>Higher interest rates (5-10%+)</li>
<li>Higher risk than government bonds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>Apple issues a 5-year bond paying 6% interest. Apple must pay, or it would face financial ruin and lawsuits.</p>
<p>#### Municipal Bonds</p>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issued by states and cities</li>
<li>Usually for infrastructure projects</li>
<li>Tax advantages (interest isn't taxed federally)</li>
<li>Lower interest rates (3-5%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>New York City issues a bond to fund a new subway line. Investors who are NYC residents get tax advantages.</p>
<h3>Key Bond Characteristics</h3>
<p><strong>Predictable Income:</strong></p>
<p>Bonds provide regular, known payments. If you need reliable income, bonds are attractive.</p>
<p><strong>Less Volatile:</strong></p>
<p>Bond prices change less dramatically than stocks. Good for risk-averse investors.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Time Horizon:</strong></p>
<p>You know when you'll get paid back (maturity date).</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Price/Interest Rate Relationship:</strong></p>
<p>If you own a 5% bond and new bonds are issued paying 6%, your bond's market price drops (because it's less attractive). If you hold to maturity, this doesn't matter. If you sell early, it does.</p>
<h3>Bonds vs Stocks: Quick Comparison</h3>
<p>| Aspect | Stocks | Bonds |</p>
<p>|--------|--------|-------|</p>
<p>| What you own | Company ownership | Company debt |</p>
<p>| Returns | Variable (growth + dividends) | Fixed (interest payments) |</p>
<p>| Predictability | Low | High |</p>
<p>| Risk | Higher | Lower |</p>
<p>| Growth potential | Higher | Lower |</p>
<p>| Income | Dividends (if any) | Interest (guaranteed) |</p>
<p>| Voting rights | Yes | No |</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SECURITIES</h2>
<p>These are securities that bundle other investments together:</p>
<h3>Mutual Funds</h3>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<p>A fund that pools money from many investors and buys a portfolio of stocks/bonds.</p>
<p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You give $1,000 to the mutual fund</li>
<li>The fund combines it with money from thousands of other investors</li>
<li>Professional managers buy stocks/bonds on behalf of all investors</li>
<li>You own shares of the mutual fund (not directly own the stocks)</li>
<li>Your returns = how well the fund's investments perform</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional management</li>
<li>Diversification (spreads risk across many investments)</li>
<li>Access to investments you couldn't afford alone</li>
<li>Easy to buy/sell</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Management fees (1-2% annually)</li>
<li>Less control (you don't pick the stocks)</li>
<li>Potential for over-diversification (can limit gains)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund pools money from 20 million investors and buys all 500 companies in the S&P 500. Your small investment gets you exposure to 500 companies.</p>
<h3>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h3>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<p>Like mutual funds but traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences from Mutual Funds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trade throughout the day (like stocks)</li>
<li>Lower fees (often 0.03-0.30%)</li>
<li>More tax-efficient</li>
<li>Greater variety available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. You can buy SPY like you buy Apple stock, but you're actually buying exposure to 500 companies.</p>
<p><strong>Why ETFs Became Popular:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower fees than mutual funds</li>
<li>Better for trading/rebalancing</li>
<li>Newer technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Index Funds</h3>
<p><strong>What They Are:</strong></p>
<p>Funds designed to track a market index.</p>
<p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
<p>An index (like the S&P 500) is a basket of companies. The fund buys the exact companies in that basket in the same proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>S&P 500 Index Fund owns the same 500 companies as the S&P 500, in the same weights. If Apple is 7% of the index, the fund holds 7% Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely low fees</li>
<li>Transparent (you know exactly what you own)</li>
<li>Historically outperform most active funds</li>
<li>Simple strategy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You get "average" returns, not better than average</li>
<li>Less exciting than picking individual stocks</li>
<li>Can't do better than the index (by definition)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Warren Buffett Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>Warren Buffett suggests most people buy S&P 500 index funds. Even he directs his estate to do this. If the greatest investor of all time recommends index funds, they're worth understanding.</p>
<h3>Comparison: Mutual Funds vs ETFs vs Individual Stocks</h3>
<p>| Aspect | Individual Stocks | Mutual Funds | ETFs | Index Funds |</p>
<p>|--------|-------------------|-------------|------|------------|</p>
<p>| Diversification | No (if you own 1) | High | High | Very High |</p>
<p>| Trading frequency | Daily | Usually daily | All day | Usually daily |</p>
<p>| Fees | Minimal | 1-2% | 0.03-0.5% | 0.03-0.25% |</p>
<p>| Control | High | Low | Low | None |</p>
<p>| Complexity | Medium | Low | Medium | Low |</p>
<p>| Time required | High | Low | Low | Very Low |</p>

<h2>4. DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (Advanced)</h2>
<h3>What are Derivatives?</h3>
<p><strong>Derivative</strong>: A security whose value is derived from another security.</p>
<p>Think of it like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bet on a sports game (value depends on the game outcome)</li>
<li>A future contract for wheat (value depends on wheat prices)</li>
<li>An option on Apple stock (value depends on Apple stock price)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Derivatives are bets on what other securities will do, not direct ownership.</p>
<h3>Options (Simplified)</h3>
<p><strong>Call Option:</strong></p>
<p>"The right to buy 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date"</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current Apple price: $150</li>
<li>You buy a call option: "Right to buy at $145 in 30 days"</li>
<li>If Apple rises to $160, you exercise: Buy at $145, worth $160 = $15/share profit</li>
<li>If Apple falls to $140, you don't exercise: You just lose the cost of the option</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Put Option:</strong></p>
<p>"The right to sell 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date"</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current Apple price: $150</li>
<li>You buy a put option: "Right to sell at $155 in 30 days"</li>
<li>If Apple falls to $130, you exercise: Sell at $155, worth $130 = $25/share profit</li>
<li>If Apple rises to $160, you don't exercise: You just lose the cost of the option</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Options Exist</h3>
<p><strong>For Hedging (Protection):</strong></p>
<p>You own Apple stock. You buy a put option to protect against sharp drops.</p>
<p><strong>For Speculation:</strong></p>
<p>You think Apple will rise. Buying calls with leverage amplifies your gains (and losses).</p>
<p><strong>For Income:</strong></p>
<p>You own stock. You sell calls to earn premium income.</p>
<h3>Options Characteristics</h3>
<p><strong>Leverage:</strong></p>
<p>Options cost less than stocks but move more dramatically in price.</p>
<p><strong>Time Decay:</strong></p>
<p>Options lose value as their expiration date approaches.</p>
<p><strong>High Risk/Reward:</strong></p>
<p>You can lose 100% of your option investment or gain 500%+.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity:</strong></p>
<p>Requires more knowledge than stocks.</p>
<p><strong>Not Recommended for Beginners:</strong></p>
<p>Understand stocks and bonds thoroughly before touching options.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. OTHER SECURITIES</h2>
<h3>Funds of Funds</h3>
<p>Funds that invest in other funds. Usually have higher fees and less transparency. Generally avoid these.</p>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<p>Tradeable goods like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Wheat</li>
<li>Copper</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually traded through futures contracts or ETFs, not directly.</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Highly volatile, emerging asset class.</p>
<h3>REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)</h3>
<p>Companies that own real estate. They must distribute 90% of profits as dividends. Good for real estate exposure without owning physical property.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong></p>
<p>You can own a piece of a company that owns office buildings across the country without actually owning a building yourself.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Security Selection Framework</h2>
<p><strong>For Beginners:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with stocks of well-known companies</li>
<li>Progress to mutual funds or ETFs for diversification</li>
<li>Learn bonds for portfolio stability</li>
<li>Leave options and derivatives until you're experienced</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conservative: Bonds (60%), Index Funds (40%)</li>
<li>Moderate: Stocks (50%), Bonds (50%)</li>
<li>Aggressive: Stocks (80%), Bonds (20%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Horizon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term (< 3 years): Bonds, Money Market</li>
<li>Medium-term (3-10 years): Mixed (stocks + bonds)</li>
<li>Long-term (> 10 years): Mostly stocks</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Building a Diversified Portfolio</h3>
<p>Imagine you have $10,000 to invest as a beginner:</p>
<p><strong>Conservative Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$4,000 in a bond fund (safe, stable)</li>
<li>$6,000 in an S&P 500 index fund (growth)</li>
<li>Result: Steady income + long-term growth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moderate Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 in individual stocks you research (Apple, Nike, etc.)</li>
<li>$3,000 in a dividend ETF (income)</li>
<li>$5,000 in a growth ETF (growth)</li>
<li>Result: Mix of learning, income, and growth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggressive Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$7,000 in individual growth stocks</li>
<li>$3,000 in a growth-focused ETF</li>
<li>Result: Higher growth potential but higher risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Prospectus and Costs</h3>
<p>Every security comes with a "prospectus" - a detailed document explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the investment does</li>
<li>Fees and expenses</li>
<li>Risk factors</li>
<li>Historical performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Always check the expense ratio (total fees as % of investment). 0.10% is great. 2%+ is expensive.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Thinking More Securities = Better Diversification</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Owning 50 stocks is not necessarily more diversified than 10 if they're similar companies. An index fund diversifies automatically.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Believing All Bonds Are Safe</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Government bonds are safe. Corporate bonds from struggling companies are risky. Check credit ratings.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Ignoring Fees</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: A 2% fee might not sound big, but over 30 years it cuts your returns by 40%. Always check expense ratios.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Buying Options Without Understanding Them</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Options can amplify losses. Don't trade them until you fully understand the mechanics and have capital you can afford to lose.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Assuming Past Performance Predicts Future Results</h3>
<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Even funds that beat the market one year often underperform the next. Consistency matters more than spectacular single years.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Investment amount: $50,000</li>
<li>Your portfolio allocation:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - Bonds: <strong><em>% ($</strong></em><em></em>)</p>
<p>  - Index Funds: <strong><em>% ($</strong></em><em></em>)</p>
<p>  - Individual Stocks: <strong><em>% ($</strong></em><em></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus (Moderate, Age 35):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investment amount: $50,000</li>
<li>Your portfolio allocation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jamie (Aggressive, Age 25):</strong></p>
<ul>

</ol>
<p>   - Direct stock purchase</p>
<p>   - Through an ETF (find one that includes it)</p>
<p>   - Through a mutual fund</p>
<p>   - Through bonds it issues (if available)</p>
<ol>
<li>For each method, research the typical costs and benefits</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Write a paragraph explaining which method you'd choose and why</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Excellent! You now understand the variety of securities available and how to choose among them.</p>
<p><strong>In the next lesson</strong>, you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
