<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>While technical analysis shows you WHAT is happening with price, fundamental analysis tells you WHY it's happening. Master fundamental analysis and you'll understand the true value of a company - whether a stock is cheap or expensive, whether it's a good investment or a risky bet. This is the tool that separates value investors from day traders.</p>
<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 25-30 minutes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completion of Chapter 6: Technical Analysis</li>
<li>Basic understanding of how companies make profit</li>
<li>Willingness to learn some accounting basics</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Core Content</h2>
<h3>What is Fundamental Analysis?</h3>
<p><strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong> is the practice of analyzing a company's financial statements, business model, competitive position, and economic factors to determine its true value.</p>
<p><strong>The Core Question:</strong> Is this stock's current price a bargain, fairly valued, or overpriced?</p>
<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The stock price today is just a guess about what the company is worth. Fundamental analysis is the detective work to determine if that guess is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you want to buy a house:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong> = Looking at recent sale prices in the neighborhood and price trends</li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong> = Inspecting the foundation, roof, plumbing, electrical, square footage, location quality</li>
</ul>
<p>A house might have sold for $300k last month, but if the foundation is cracked (fundamental issue), the price should be lower. That's fundamental analysis.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Stock Traders</h3>
<p>#### 1. Technical Traders</p>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Price and chart patterns</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where is price going next?</p>
<p><strong>Hold Time:</strong> Hours to weeks</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> Charts, volume, indicators</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Trend reversal without warning</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong> A day trader buys Apple at $150 because it bounced from a moving average, regardless of whether Apple's profits are growing or shrinking.</p>
<p>#### 2. Fundamental Investors</p>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Business value and economics</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is this company worth more or less than the stock price?</p>
<p><strong>Hold Time:</strong> Months to years</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> Financial statements, industry trends, management</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Less affected by short-term price swings</p>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong> A fundamental investor buys Apple at $150 because the company earned $6/share (P/E of 25), dividends are growing, and the company has $200B in cash.</p>
<h3>The Three Pillars of Fundamental Analysis</h3>
<p>#### Pillar 1: Financial Statements (Company's Health)</p>
<p>Every public company must publish three financial statements quarterly and annually:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Income Statement</strong> (Profit & Loss)</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Shows revenue, expenses, and profit</p>
<p>   - Answer: Is the company making money?</p>
<p>   - Key metric: Net Income (bottom line profit)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong> (Assets & Liabilities)</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Shows what the company owns and owes</p>
<p>   - Answer: Does the company have financial strength?</p>
<p>   - Key metric: Total Assets minus Total Liabilities</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> (Cash Movement)</li>
</ol>
<p>   - Shows where cash came from and where it went</p>
<p>   - Answer: Is the company generating cash?</p>
<p>   - Key metric: Operating Cash Flow</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple's Basic Financials</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Year: 2023 (Fiscal)



Revenue: $383 billion (money in)

Expenses: $312 billion (money out)

Net Income: $99 billion (profit)



Total Assets: $352 billion

Total Liabilities: $123 billion

Shareholder Equity: $229 billion



Operating Cash Flow: $110 billion

</code></pre>
<p><strong>What This Tells Us:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple made $99B in profit (excellent)</li>
<li>Assets exceed liabilities by $229B (strong balance sheet)</li>
<li>Generated $110B in actual cash (not just paper profit)</li>
</ul>
<p>#### Pillar 2: Valuation Metrics (Price vs. Value)</p>
<p>Valuation metrics help you answer: "Is this stock expensive or cheap?"</p>
<p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>Formula</th>
            <th>What It Means</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td>
            <td>Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share</td>
            <td>How many dollars you pay for $1 of profit</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>P/B Ratio</strong></td>
            <td>Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share</td>
            <td>How many dollars you pay for $1 of assets</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td>
            <td>Annual Dividend ÷ Stock Price</td>
            <td>How much annual income you get</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Price-to-Sales</strong></td>
            <td>Market Cap ÷ Total Revenue</td>
            <td>How many dollars you pay per $1 of sales</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Real Example: Apple vs. Tesla</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Apple:

- Stock price: $180

- Earnings per share: $6

- P/E Ratio: 180 ÷ 6 = 30

- Interpretation: Pay $30 for every $1 of profit



Tesla:

- Stock price: $250

- Earnings per share: $2

- P/E Ratio: 250 ÷ 2 = 125

- Interpretation: Pay $125 for every $1 of profit



Conclusion: Apple looks cheaper than Tesla

Why: Tesla is speculative growth, Apple is mature/stable

</code></pre>
<p>#### Pillar 3: Business Quality (Competitive Advantage)</p>
<p>Beyond numbers, fundamental analysts ask: Does this company have a "moat" (competitive advantage)?</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Moats:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brand Moat</strong> (Strong brand harder to replace)</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple: Best tech brand in world</li>
<li>Nike: Premium athletic brand</li>
<li>Coca-Cola: Iconic beverage brand</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network Effect</strong> (More users = more valuable)</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook: Only valuable because everyone is there</li>
<li>MasterCard: More merchants = more customers attracted</li>
<li>Netflix: More subscribers = better recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Switching Cost</strong> (Hard to leave once you buy)</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office: Switching away is expensive</li>
<li>QuickBooks: Accounting software deeply integrated</li>
<li>Adobe Creative Suite: Industry standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost Advantage</strong> (Produce cheaper than competitors)</p>
<ul>
<li>Walmart: Massive scale = lowest costs</li>
<li>Amazon: Logistics network, data efficiency</li>
<li>Tesla: Manufacturing automation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Netflix Moat Analysis</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Why is Netflix defensible despite competition?



Moat 1: Scale/Network Effect

- 250M subscribers

- Massive content budget ($17B/year)

- New competitor can&#39;t afford similar content

- So you must subscribe to Netflix for best shows



Moat 2: Data/Technology

- AI recommendations improve with more users

- 250M users = massive data advantage

- Technology hard to replicate



Moat 3: Content

- Original shows (Stranger Things, etc.)

- Can&#39;t watch these anywhere else

- Creates switching cost



Fundamental investor conclusion:

Netflix is more defensible than a company with no moat

Therefore, Netflix can sustain higher profit margins and P/E ratio

</code></pre>
<h3>Why Fundamental Analysis Matters</h3>
<p>#### Reason 1: Understanding True Value</p>
<p>A stock's price today is driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply and demand (what buyers/sellers agree on)</li>
<li>Emotion (fear, greed, hype)</li>
<li>Technical factors (trends, patterns)</li>
<li><strong>Fundamental value</strong> (what the company is actually worth)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good investors use fundamental analysis to find gaps between price and value.</p>
<p><strong>Real Example: Tesla Valuation Debate</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Some argue Tesla is overvalued:

- P/E Ratio 60+ (expensive vs. other car makers)

- Profits still small vs. revenue

- Strong competition coming



Others argue Tesla is fairly valued:

- Leading in electric vehicles

- Expanding margins (profit improving)

- Growth potential in energy storage



Both sides use fundamental analysis to support their view

Fundamental investors can debate valuations with data

</code></pre>
<p>#### Reason 2: Identifying Growing Companies</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis reveals which companies are growing and which are struggling.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Company Signals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue increasing 15%+ year over year</li>
<li>Profit margins expanding (making more profit per sale)</li>
<li>Return on equity improving (using assets more efficiently)</li>
<li>Free cash flow positive and growing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Declining Company Signals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue flat or declining</li>
<li>Profit margins shrinking</li>
<li>Increasing debt</li>
<li>Negative cash flow</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Example: Growth vs. Decline</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Software Company A:

- Year 1 Revenue: $100M, Profit: $10M

- Year 2 Revenue: $150M, Profit: $20M

- Year 3 Revenue: $220M, Profit: $40M

Signal: GROWTH (revenue +50%, profit +100%)



Manufacturing Company B:

- Year 1 Revenue: $1000M, Profit: $100M

- Year 2 Revenue: $950M, Profit: $80M

- Year 3 Revenue: $900M, Profit: $60M

Signal: DECLINE (revenue -10%, profit -40%)



Investors should pay higher multiple for Company A

</code></pre>
<p>#### Reason 3: Avoiding Value Traps</p>
<p>Not all cheap stocks are good bargains. Some are "value traps" - stocks that are cheap for a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>Value Trap Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock trading at P/E of 8 (very cheap vs. market P/E 20)



Reason 1: Company is in decline

- Profits falling

- Lost market share

- Technology obsolete

Verdict: Cheap for a reason - VALUE TRAP



Reason 2: Company is undervalued

- Solid profits, stable business

- Market pessimistic temporarily

- Management buying shares

Verdict: Cheap for temporary reason - OPPORTUNITY



Fundamental analysis tells you which is which

<h3>The Fundamental Analysis Workflow</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Understand the Business</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does the company do?</li>
<li>How does it make money?</li>
<li>What industry is it in?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Read Financial Statements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is revenue growing?</li>
<li>Are profits growing?</li>
<li>Is cash flow positive?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate Valuation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>P/E ratio vs. historical average</li>
<li>P/E ratio vs. industry average</li>
<li>Other valuation metrics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Analyze Competition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who are main competitors?</li>
<li>What's the competitive advantage?</li>
<li>Is it defensible?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Project the Future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will profits grow 5, 10, 20%?</li>
<li>Where will the stock be worth in 5 years?</li>
<li>Margin of safety?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Make Investment Decision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the risk worth the reward?</li>
<li>Does the margin of safety exist?</li>
<li>What could go wrong?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fundamental vs. Technical: The Complete Trader</h3>
<p>The most successful traders combine both:</p>
<pre><code>
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:

When to trade (timing)

Where to enter (price level)

Where to stop loss (risk management)

When to exit (reversal signals)



FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:

What to trade (which stocks)

Why to trade it (value thesis)

How long to hold (investment thesis)

How much to risk (conviction level)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Real Example: Complete Trading Decision</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Step 1: Fundamental Analysis (What to trade)

- Research biotech companies

- Find Company X with promising drug trial

- P/E ratio low (50 vs. biotech average 200)

- Thesis: Stock undervalued if trial succeeds



Step 2: Technical Analysis (When to trade)

- Chart shows hammer candlestick on 20-day EMA

- RSI bouncing from 35 (oversold)

- MACD just turned positive

- Signal: Good technical entry point



Step 3: Combined Decision

- Fundamental thesis = BUY (stock is cheap)

- Technical setup = BUY (good entry point)

- Conviction: HIGH

- Action: BUY with full position size



Result:

- If you bought on technical signal alone, you might exit too early

- If you analyzed fundamental thesis, you know why you own it

- Combined approach = best results

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Buying Without Understanding the Business</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You buy a stock because the chart looks good, but you don't know what the company does.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Spend 30 minutes learning about the business first. Read the "business summary" on their investor relations site.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring Financial Statements</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> P/E ratio looks cheap, so you buy. Later you learn the company is losing money.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always check if the company is profitable before buying based on valuation metrics.</p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Mistaking Cheap for Undervalued</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Stock has low P/E, so it must be cheap. But you don't check if that low P/E is because profits are collapsing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compare current P/E to historical and industry average. Look at profit trends.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Assuming Growth Will Always Continue</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Bought Microsoft at $300 expecting 30% annual growth forever.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Research shows most companies eventually mature and slow down. What growth rate is sustainable?</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: Ignoring Management Quality</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Company has great fundamentals, but management is inexperienced or dishonest.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Research CEO background, board experience, insider trading activity.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
<h3>Fundamental Analysis in Practice</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: Deciding Between Two Tech Stocks</strong></p>
<pre><code>
Stock A: Microsoft

- Revenue: $200B (growing 10%/year)

- Net Income: $70B (35% profit margin)

- P/E: 35

- Dividend Yield: 0.9%

- Moat: Office software, cloud dominance

- Debt: Low

- Cash: $100B



Stock B: Upstart AI Company

- Revenue: $0.5B (growing 50%/year)

- Net Income: -$50M (losing money)

- P/E: N/A (no earnings)

- Dividend Yield: 0%

- Moat: Technology (but unclear if defensible)

- Debt: Increasing

- Cash: $200M



Which is better?



Answer: Depends on your time horizon and risk tolerance

- Microsoft: Lower growth, higher quality, less risk

- Upstart: Higher growth potential, higher risk, unproven



Both require fundamental analysis to understand the tradeoff

<h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Business Understanding</h3>
<p>Pick a company you use every day (Apple, Netflix, Starbucks, etc.):</p>
<ol>
<li>How does the company make money?</li>
<li>Who are its main competitors?</li>
<li>What is its competitive advantage?</li>
<li>Is that advantage defensible long-term?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Answer: Apple</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sells hardware (iPhones, Macs, etc.) and services (App Store, Apple Music, iCloud)</li>
<li>Competitors: Samsung, Google, Microsoft, others</li>
<li>Advantages: Brand strength, ecosystem lock-in, vertical integration</li>
<li>Defensible: Yes - switching away from iPhone/Mac is expensive</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 2: Financial Statement Review</h3>
<p>Go to investor.apple.com or sec.gov and find Apple's most recent income statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>What was Apple's total revenue?</li>
<li>What was Apple's net income (profit)?</li>
<li>Calculate profit margin: Net Income ÷ Revenue</li>
<li>Is the profit margin good? (Most companies 5-20%, Apple probably higher)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 3: Valuation Calculation</h3>
<p>Using Apple as example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find current Apple stock price</li>
<li>Find Apple's earnings per share (EPS) for the most recent quarter (annualize it)</li>
<li>Calculate P/E Ratio: Stock Price ÷ EPS</li>
<li>Research S&P 500 average P/E (around 20-25 typically)</li>
<li>Is Apple's P/E higher or lower than market average? What does this mean?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>✓ <strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong> = Understanding true value of business</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Three Pillars</strong> = Financial statements, valuation metrics, business quality</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Moat</strong> = Competitive advantage that's defensible</p>
<p>✓ <strong>P/E Ratio</strong> = Quick valuation metric (how many dollars per $1 profit)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Growth</strong> = Revenue and profit increasing year over year</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Cash Flow</strong> = More important than profit (actual money the company generates)</p>
<p>✓ <strong>Value Trap</strong> = Cheap stock that's cheap for a reason (avoid these)</p>
