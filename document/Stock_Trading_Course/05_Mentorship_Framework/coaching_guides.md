## PART 3: COACHING FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Knowledge Gap Coaching

**When:** Student lacks understanding of a concept

**Your Goal:** Help student understand through discovery, not lecture

**Coaching Questions:**

1. "What do you currently understand about [concept]?"
2. "Where does this concept fit in the bigger picture?"
3. "Can you show me an example of [concept] in action?"
4. "What would you do if you encountered this in real trading?"
5. "What's still confusing about this?"
6. "What would you need to understand this better?"

**Your Role:**
- Ask guiding questions rather than give answers
- Use examples and analogies
- Connect to student's existing knowledge
- Suggest resources for deeper learning
- Check understanding through explanation

**Example Conversation:**

Student: "I don't understand how volatility affects position sizing."

Coach: "Good question. What do you understand about volatility right now?"

Student: "It's how much a stock moves up and down."

Coach: "Perfect. Now, if you're trading a stock that moves 50 cents per trade versus one that moves 5 cents, how might that affect the position size you use?"

Student: "Oh... the one that moves 5 cents less risk, so I could size bigger?"

Coach: "Exactly. You're thinking about it correctly. How would you calculate that difference?"

---

### Scenario 2: Performance Slump Coaching

**When:** Student is experiencing losses or lower win rates

**Your Goal:** Identify root cause and rebuild confidence

**Coaching Questions:**

1. "Walk me through your recent trades. What happened?"
2. "Do you see a pattern in your losses?"
3. "What was different about your winners?"
4. "How are you feeling emotionally?"
5. "Are you following your trading plan?"
6. "What do you think is causing this?"
7. "What's in your control to change?"
8. "What do you need to get back on track?"

**Your Role:**
- Stay calm and supportive (don't match their panic)
- Help separate emotions from data
- Identify the real issue (psychology, strategy, timing, discipline)
- Focus on controllable factors
- Rebuild confidence with wins

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Signs | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Plan deviation | Not following rules | Review plan, reset discipline |
| Psychology | Emotional trading, revenge | Focus on psychology, smaller positions |
| Bad strategy | Works poorly overall | Return to backtests, refine strategy |
| Market mismatch | Works in some conditions only | Adapt to current market, add filters |
| Bad timing | Right plan, wrong timing | Review entry signals, refine timing |
| Overtrading | Too many trades | Reduce frequency, focus on quality |
| Lack of focus | Trying everything | Return to one proven strategy |

**Example Conversation:**

Student: "I've lost $2,000 this week. I think I'm not cut out for this."

Coach: "I hear you—that's frustrating. Let's look at the data. Tell me about a couple of these losing trades."

Student: "Well, I took a trade that I said I wouldn't take because the setup wasn't perfect but I was down already and..."

Coach: "Okay, so that trade deviated from your plan. Was that one trade, or did you take several outside your plan this week?"

Student: "Several, actually."

Coach: "That makes sense. Your strategy works when you follow it. But this week you deviated. What was driving that—the losing streak getting to you?"

Student: "Yeah. After the first couple losses, I got desperate and started taking whatever I could."

Coach: "That's very human. It's also called revenge trading. So the issue isn't your strategy or your ability—it's that you need better psychology tools when you're down. Let's talk about how to handle drawdowns better."

---

### Scenario 3: Decision-Making Coaching

**When:** Student is unsure how to make a trading decision

**Your Goal:** Help student develop decision-making framework

**Coaching Questions:**

1. "What's the decision you need to make?"
2. "What are your options?"
3. "What does your trading plan say?"
4. "What are the pros and cons of each option?"
5. "What's the risk of each choice?"
6. "What would your best self do?"
7. "What does the data show?"
8. "How confident are you in each option?"

**Your Role:**
- Help them see their options clearly
- Connect decision to trading plan
- Help weigh pros and cons
- Support their decision-making process
- Reinforce confidence in their judgment

**Example Conversation:**

Student: "I have a position up 20%. Should I take profits or hold for more?"

Coach: "Good question. What does your trading plan say for this situation?"

Student: "My plan says to take half at 2:1 risk/reward and let the other half run with a trailing stop."

Coach: "And are you at that 2:1 point right now?"

Student: "Yes, exactly."

Coach: "So what's making you question whether to follow your plan?"

Student: "I don't want to leave money on the table. What if it keeps going up?"

Coach: "That's a fair feeling. But let me ask—if you follow your plan and it does keep going up, what happens?"

Student: "I still have half the position on."

Coach: "Right. And if it reverses and you'd held the whole thing?"

Student: "I'd have given back more."

Coach: "So your plan actually addresses this scenario. It lets you take profits while staying in the game. I think the question isn't whether to follow your plan, but whether you trust it. Do you?"

Student: "Yeah, I do. I'll follow it."

---

### Scenario 4: Confidence & Mindset Coaching

**When:** Student lacks confidence or doubts their ability

**Your Goal:** Build confidence through evidence and reframing

**Coaching Questions:**

1. "What's making you doubt yourself?"
2. "Is that thought based on evidence or emotion?"
3. "What evidence do you have that you CAN do this?"
4. "What have you overcome before?"
5. "What have you learned so far?"
6. "What's one thing you're doing well?"
7. "What would confidence look like for you?"
8. "What's one small thing you could do this week to build confidence?"

**Your Role:**
- Separate emotion from reality
- Point out progress they might be missing
- Help them see their capabilities
- Normalize fear and doubt in learning
- Build confidence through small wins

**Confidence Builders:**
- Remind them of past successes
- Highlight specific skills they've developed
- Point out measurable progress
- Celebrate small wins
- Help them see how far they've come

**Example Conversation:**

Student: "I don't think I have what it takes to be a trader. Maybe this isn't for me."

Coach: "I hear doubt. Before we go there, let me ask—when did you start trading?"

Student: "6 weeks ago."

Coach: "And where were you then vs. now?"

Student: "Oh, I know way more than I did."

Coach: "Give me specifics. What are three things you understand now that you didn't 6 weeks ago?"

Student: "I understand how to read a chart. I know what support and resistance mean. I can calculate position sizing."

Coach: "So you've mastered three significant skills in 6 weeks. That doesn't sound like someone without talent. That sounds like someone learning. What made you feel like you don't have what it takes?"

Student: "I had two losing trades this week."

Coach: "I see. Two losing trades in a week means you don't have talent?"

Student: "No, I guess that's normal."

Coach: "It is. Professional traders have losing trades constantly. The question isn't whether you'll have losses—you will. The question is whether you'll learn from them and keep improving. Are you doing that?"

Student: "Yes."

Coach: "Then you have what it takes. The next 6 weeks will show even more progress."

---

### Scenario 5: Strategy Adjustment Coaching

**When:** Student needs to refine or change their trading strategy

**Your Goal:** Help them evaluate and improve their approach

**Coaching Questions:**

1. "How is your current strategy performing?"
2. "What's working and what's not?"
3. "What would make it better?"
4. "What does the data show?"
5. "Have you backtested this change?"
6. "What's the risk of changing it?"
7. "What's the risk of not changing it?"
8. "What's your plan to test the change?"

**Your Role:**
- Help them evaluate strategy objectively
- Guide backtesting and analysis
- Prevent impulsive changes based on emotion
- Help identify the real issue
- Support methodical improvement

**Common Strategy Issues:**

| Issue | Question | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Low win rate | Is strategy working in backtests? | Return to backtested version |
| False edge | Does it work or just happened to? | Backtest more data, add filters |
| Market dependent | Only works in some conditions? | Add market filter, adapt to conditions |
| Timing issues | Right direction, wrong entry? | Refine entry signal |
| Exits incomplete | Wins too small, losses too large? | Improve exit strategy |
| Overtrading | Too many signals? | Add filters, reduce frequency |

**Example Conversation:**

Student: "My strategy only has a 45% win rate. I want to change it."

Coach: "Before we change it, let's understand it better. When you backtested this strategy, what was the win rate?"

Student: "About 48%."

Coach: "So the backtest and live trading are pretty close. That's actually good. And your backtest was profitable at 48%?"

Student: "Yes, because my wins were bigger than my losses."

Coach: "So the win rate isn't really the issue, is it? You have a working strategy. What's really bothering you?"

Student: "I lose two or three in a row and it feels bad."

Coach: "But that's expected in your backtest too, right?"

Student: "Yeah."

Coach: "So the issue is your psychology around short losing streaks, not your strategy. Making changes to your strategy won't fix that. But improving how you handle losing streaks will. What do you think?"

Student: "You're right. I need to work on accepting that part of the process."

## PART 4: FEEDBACK FRAMEWORKS

### How to Give Effective Feedback

**Purpose:** Help student learn and improve, not criticize

**Structure:**

1. **Acknowledge Effort**
   - "I can see you put in real effort this week"
   - "You clearly care about improving"
   - "That took courage to share"

2. **Specific Observation**
   - Focus on behavior, not personality
   - Reference specific examples
   - Use data when available
   - "In those last three trades, you didn't follow your stop loss on two of them"

3. **Impact Statement**
   - Explain the consequence
   - Connect to their goals
   - "That deviation cost you $200 in losses that your plan would have prevented"

4. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
   - Ask what they think
   - Offer suggestions, don't demand
   - "How could we prevent that next time?"
   - "What support would help you stay disciplined?"

5. **Encouragement & Belief**
   - Express confidence
   - Point to capability
   - "I know you can do this. You've done it before"

### Feedback Examples

**Situation 1: Student missed trade signal**

Less Effective: "You're not paying attention."

Better: "I noticed in our review that the setup on Tuesday matched your criteria, but you didn't take the trade. What happened?"

Student: "I was busy."

You: "I get it—life happens. That trade would have made money. How can we set up your system so you don't miss important setups? Would an alert help?"

**Situation 2: Student took a trade outside the plan**

Less Effective: "You never follow your plan."

Better: "I see you took three trades this week that weren't in your setup criteria. Tell me about those—what triggered them?"

Student: "I was down $300 and wanted to make it back quick."

You: "That's understandable, but it cost you another $200. That's something we need to address. When you're down, what could you do instead of breaking your rules?"

**Situation 3: Student showed great discipline**

Less Effective: "Good job."

Better: "I'm impressed with how you managed that drawdown. You could have broken your plan like last time, but you didn't. What helped you stay disciplined this time?"

Student: "I remembered our conversation about recovery."

You: "Exactly. You're building real discipline. That's one of the biggest predictors of success. Keep building that muscle."

### Step 10: Commit & Schedule Follow-up

**Commitment:** "I will ______________________________ by ___________________"

**Next check-in:** _________________________________

**Example Problem-Solving Session:**

Coach: "Let's use our problem-solving framework. What's the problem you want to solve?"

Student: "I keep making impulsive trades that break my plan."

Coach: "Okay. When did this start happening?"

Student: "The last two weeks."

Coach: "Anything different about those two weeks?"

Student: "I lost money the first week and I was trying to make it back."

Coach: "So the problem started when you had losses. Do you understand your strategy?"

Student: "Yes."

Coach: "Can you execute it when emotions are calm?"

Student: "Yes."

Coach: "So the root cause is psychology—when you're down, you're making emotional decisions. That's my understanding. Does that match yours?"

Student: "Yeah."

Coach: "Okay, let's brainstorm solutions. What could help you stay calm when you're down?"

[Brainstorm...]

Student: "Maybe I shouldn't trade the day after a big loss?"

Coach: "That's one option. What else?"

Student: "Or I could reduce position size when I'm emotional."

Coach: "Good. Or use an alert system so I don't miss the setup and feel rushed."

Student: "Or remind myself that recovery is the plan, not revenge."

Coach: "Excellent. Now which of these would actually help you the most?"

Student: "Probably reducing position size. Then I'm not tempted to break my rules."

Coach: "Why that one?"

Student: "Because smaller losses won't create the desperation that makes me break my plan."

Coach: "I think that's wise. So here's your action plan: When you have a losing day, your next trading day you automatically trade 50% position size. Can you do that?"

Student: "Yes."

Coach: "How will we know if it's working?"

Student: "I'll have fewer impulsive trades, and I'll stay profitable over the month."

Coach: "Perfect. Let's check in next week on whether you've had any losing days and how you handled them."
