## Part 1: The Setup and Entry

### Stock Selection: Mobileye (MBLY)

**Company Background:**
- Spun off from Intel in October 2023 (this is January 2024 simulation)
- Autonomous driving technology company
- First earnings report coming late April
- Business: Self-driving car AI, safety systems

**Why This Stock for Swing Trading:**
1. Recent IPO - higher volatility = bigger swings
2. Upcoming earnings catalyst - binary event
3. Technical bounce off support - defined entry point
4. Sector rotation into AI names - trend winds at your back

### Technical Setup: The Chart Pattern

**Pre-trade Analysis (April 10, 2023):**

```
Chart Price Points:
Mar 15: High of $58.44 (post-IPO peak)
Apr 3:  Low of $42.15 (sold off hard)
Apr 10: Trading at $47.23 (15% recovery but still down)
```

**The Chart Pattern Identified: Inverse Head and Shoulders**

```
               Neck Line @ $47.50
              /              \
             /                \
    Left         Head          Right
   Shoulder    (Low @ $42.15)  Shoulder
    @ $45
   /     \                     /    \
  /       \                   /      \
$48       $43                $47      $48
```

**Technical Indicators Alignment:**

1. **Support Level**: $45-46 (strong bounce zone)
   - Price bounced here twice in March-April
   - Volume increased on bounces
   - Psychological support (round number)

2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - April 8: RSI = 28 (Oversold, below 30)
   - April 10: RSI = 35 (Still depressed, recovery likely)
   - Reading: Stock oversold, bounce probable

3. **Moving Averages**:
   - 50-day MA: $50.20
   - 200-day MA: $52.80 (not yet, but target)
   - Price below all major MAs = defined bounce target

4. **Volume Analysis**:
   - March 15-29: Average 12M shares/day
   - April 3: Sold off with 18M shares (panic selling)
   - April 4-10: Average 8M shares (declining volume)
   - Interpretation: Selling pressure fading

### The Entry Decision

**Trader Profile: James Chen**
- Experience level: Intermediate (3 years trading)
- Trading account: $75,000
- Risk per trade: 3% ($2,250)
- Style: Technical patterns + momentum
- Win rate: 58% on swing trades

**Entry Analysis (April 11, 2023):**

James reviews the technical setup:

1. **Pattern Check**: Inverse H&S forming ✓
2. **Support confirmed**: Price bounced at $45.48 on April 11 ✓
3. **RSI check**: RSI at 35, moving above 30 ✓
4. **Catalyst**: Earnings coming April 27 ✓
5. **Risk/Reward**: Can define clear stop loss ✓

**Entry Details:**

```
Date: April 11, 2023
Time: 9:47 AM EST
Entry Price: $47.23
Entry Quantity: 317 shares ($47.23 × 317 = $14,970)
Stop Loss: $45.48 (below support level)
Risk: $47.23 - $45.48 = $1.75 × 317 = $555

Wait, that's not $2,250 risk. James adjusts:
- Actually buys 450 shares at $47.23 = $21,254 (on margin)
- Stop loss at $45.48
- Risk: $1.75 × 450 = $787.50

This still seems light for his typical 3% risk.
Let me recalculate with proper position sizing:

Target profit: 20% gain = $9,446
Risk tolerance: 2% of $75,000 = $1,500
Position size: $1,500 / ($47.23 - $45.48) × 1 = 857 shares

Actually, James uses simpler math:
- Risk: $2,250 (3% of $75,000 account)
- Stop loss: $45.48
- Risk per share: $1.75
- Shares: $2,250 / $1.75 = 1,286 shares
```

**Final Entry Position:**
- Shares: 1,286 MBLY
- Entry price: $47.23
- Total cost: $60,782 (half margin financed)
- Stop loss: $45.48 (hard stop, non-negotiable)
- Risk: $2,250
- Target profit (20% move): $11,365
- Risk/Reward: 1 to 5 (actually better than planned 1 to 4)

**Entry Confirmation Email to Himself:**
> "Entered MBLY at $47.23 with 1,286 shares. Clear inverse H&S pattern, RSI recovering from 28 oversold condition, earnings April 27 catalyst. Stop at $45.48, risk $2,250. Target $56+ based on 50-day MA breakout, then $60+ if earnings beat. Will take profits on the way up. Do not hold through earnings."

## Part 2: The Holding Period (April 11 - May 2)

### Week 1: Bounce Begins

**April 12-14 (Days 2-4):**

```
Date    Price    Change      Volume    Comment
Apr 12  $48.75   +3.2%       11M       Good bounce, no resistance yet
Apr 13  $50.12   +6.2%       10M       Breaking 50-day MA ($50.20)
Apr 14  $51.88   +9.8%       12M       Strong momentum, near $52
```

**James's Thought Process (April 14):**
> "Perfect setup. Broke the 50-day MA, bouncing nicely. RSI at 58 (not overbought yet). Volume is decent. This could run to $56-58 before earnings. I'll let this run, taking profits on the way up."

**Decision Point 1: Partial Profit Taking**
- Sells 386 shares (30% of position) at $51.88
- Realizes profit: $386 × ($51.88 - $47.23) = $1,797
- Remaining position: 900 shares at average cost of $47.23
- Locks in partial win, lets winners run

**Why this decision works:**
- Takes profits on first target ($50+ area)
- Reduces position size while still maintaining exposure
- Locks in a win (removes emotional pressure)
- Remaining position is smaller (easier to hold)

### Week 2: Building Momentum

**April 17-21 (Days 6-10):**

```
Date    Price    Change      Volume    Comment
Apr 17  $52.45   +11.0%      8M        Higher lows forming, trend intact
Apr 18  $54.23   +14.8%      9M        Pulling back slightly
Apr 19  $56.47   +19.6%      11M       Breaking through $56, strong close
Apr 20  $57.82   +22.4%      12M       Higher highs, momentum accelerating
Apr 21  $58.95   +24.8%      13M       Approaching $60, volume strong
```

**Technical Developments:**
- Price now above 50-day MA ($50.20) ✓
- Price approaching 200-day MA ($52.80) ✓
- RSI at 72 (approaching overbought at 70)
- MACD positive and accelerating
- Earnings announcement still 6 days away

**James's Monitoring (April 21):**
> "This is working perfectly. Up 24% in 10 days. I have 900 shares left from original 1,286. The $56+ target is hit, but earnings is April 27 - should I hold through or take profits now?

> Decision: I'm not holding through earnings. Too much binary risk. But I'll wait for a pullback or higher level. If it pulls back to $56-57, I'll sell another 30%. If it keeps running, I'll sell half of remaining at $60."

**Decision Point 2: Scale Out Plan**
James sets scaling-out rules:
- If price reaches $60: Sell 450 shares
- If price pulls back to $56: Sell 300 shares
- Will hold 150 shares for the long-term upside IF earnings are great
- But wants majority of gains locked in before earnings announcement

### Week 3: The Final Push

**April 24-27 (Days 13-16):**

```
Date    Price    Change      Volume    Comment
Apr 24  $59.44   +25.8%      14M       Approaching $60, all-time high approach
Apr 25  $60.18   +27.4%      15M       Broke $60! Volume spike
Apr 26  $61.47   +30.2%      13M       Continuing higher, earnings tomorrow
Apr 27  Earnings released 4:00 PM
```

**Earnings Announcement (April 27 @ 4:00 PM):**
- EPS beat: $0.08 vs. expected $0.04 (100% beat)
- Revenue beat: $476M vs. expected $450M (6% beat)
- Guidance: Raised full-year guidance by 15%
- Stock reacts: After-hours trading up 8%
- Next day open: Gap up to $66.30

**James's Decisions During This Period:**

**Decision Point 3: Partial Exit at $59.50 (April 24)**
- Sells 450 shares at $59.50
- Realized profit: 450 × ($59.50 - $47.23) = $5,521
- Remaining position: 450 shares
- Total realized gains so far: $1,797 + $5,521 = $7,318

**Decision Point 4: Hold Through Earnings (April 27)**
- Decides to hold 450 shares through earnings
- "The beats are coming, this company looks good"
- Sets mental stop at $57 (if it sells off badly)

**This is actually good judgment:**
- 99% of the position profit is locked in
- Only 35% of original shares still held
- Still participating if earnings boom
- If it crashes, he's still massively up

## Part 3: The Exit

### April 27-May 2: The Exit Phase

**April 27 After-Hours:**
- Price gaps up to $65.20 in after-hours trading
- Trading volume: 20M shares (huge)
- James checks app before bed: Up another $7.97/share

**April 28 (Friday, Day 17):**

```
Time    Price    Volume    James's Action
9:35    $66.30   Opening   Checks price, stock is up 8% after hours, still moving
10:15   $65.89   2M        Realizes stock pulled back slightly from $66.30 high
11:00   $65.47   1.5M      Deciding what to do
```

**James's Exit Decision (April 28, 11:02 AM):**

Internal monologue:
> "Earnings beat big. Stock up 40%. I have 450 shares left from original 1,286. The trade thesis is complete. Should I hold for more upside or lock in the win?

> Pros of holding:
> - Momentum is strong
> - Earnings were great
> - Stock could continue higher
> - I've already locked in most gains

> Cons of holding:
> - Already got 40% gain in 17 days
> - Risk/reward no longer favorable
> - Stock has run from $47 to $65, parabolic
> - Better opportunities elsewhere with 3% risk
> - This was supposed to be 3-week trade, now it's earnings follow-through

> Decision: Exit remaining position. Lock in the win. Find next opportunity."

**Final Exit:**
- Date: April 28, 2023
- Time: 11:02 AM
- Exit Price: $65.89 (slightly better than price when he decided)
- Shares: 450
- Realized Profit: 450 × ($65.89 - $47.23) = $8,397

**Total Trade Summary:**

| Stage | Shares | Price | Amount | P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Entry (Apr 11) | 1,286 | $47.23 | -$60,782 | - |
| Partial Exit 1 (Apr 14) | 386 | $51.88 | +$19,925 | +$1,797 |
| Partial Exit 2 (Apr 24) | 450 | $59.50 | +$26,775 | +$5,521 |
| Final Exit (Apr 28) | 450 | $65.89 | +$29,651 | +$8,397 |
| **TOTAL PROFIT** | | | | **+$15,715** |

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully:

```
Initial Entry:
- 1,286 shares at $47.23 = $60,782 cost

Sales:
1. Apr 14: 386 shares at $51.88 = $19,925 revenue
   Profit: 386 × ($51.88 - $47.23) = $1,797

2. Apr 24: 450 shares at $59.50 = $26,775 revenue
   Profit: 450 × ($59.50 - $47.23) = $5,521

3. Apr 28: 450 shares at $65.89 = $29,651 revenue
   Profit: 450 × ($65.89 - $47.23) = $8,397

Total revenue: $19,925 + $26,775 + $29,651 = $76,351
Total cost: $60,782
Total profit: $76,351 - $60,782 = $15,569

Average exit price: $15,569 / 1,286 = $12.11 per share gain
Percentage gain: $12.11 / $47.23 = +25.6% overall

But that's not the right way to think about it...
```

**Correct Profit Calculation:**

```
Realized Profit = Sum of (Exit Price - Entry Price) × Shares Sold

Sale 1: ($51.88 - $47.23) × 386 = $1,797
Sale 2: ($59.50 - $47.23) × 450 = $5,521
Sale 3: ($65.89 - $47.23) × 450 = $8,397

Total Realized Profit: $15,715

As a percentage:
Average selling price: $76,351 / 1,286 = $59.35
Return: ($59.35 - $47.23) / $47.23 = +25.6%

But the 39% figure from the summary:
- Entry: $47.23
- Final exit: $65.89
- Return: ($65.89 - $47.23) / $47.23 = +39.4%
- This would be the return if all shares held to the end at $65.89
```

Actually, let me reconsider the entire position sizing. If James had $2,250 risk at $1.75 stop distance:

$2,250 / $1.75 = 1,285 shares at $47.23 = exactly $60,782

The profit of $15,715 is the realized amount. Let me think about the case study framing...

The case should show the +39% return based on the ending price being $65.89. So perhaps James held the full position? Let me reframe this:

---

Actually, for clarity, let me rewrite the exit section to show a simpler version:

### April 28: Full Exit

**James's Exit Strategy:**
- Set soft targets: $56 (lock 50% profit), $60 (lock another 25%), $65+ (hold final 25%)
- Earnings are a catalyst to de-risk
- Has locked in $7,318 profit on 600 shares already
- Remaining: 686 shares from original 1,286

**The Final Exit:**
On April 28, after the earnings beat and gap-up, James reviews:
- Original entry: 1,286 shares at $47.23
- Current price: $65.89
- Total gain: ($65.89 - $47.23) × 1,286 = $24,011
- Return: +39.4%
- Duration: 17 days

**Exit decision:**
> "Earnings beat confirmed the thesis. Stock up 40%. Risk/reward no longer attractive. Time to lock this in and move to next opportunity."

Actually, I realize the numbers need to be consistent. Let me present it as:

---

## Part 3: The Exit (Revised)

### April 28: Final Exit

**Market Conditions:**
- Stock gapped up 8% after earnings beat on April 27
- Trading at $65.89 (peak intraday $66.30)
- Massive volume (20M shares) showing participation
- Momentum intact but entry thesis complete

**James's Exit Decision:**

Position at exit:
- Shares held: 1,286
- Entry price: $47.23
- Exit price: $65.89
- Profit per share: $18.66
- Total profit: $24,011
- Return: +39.4%
- Holding period: 17 days

**Trade Summary:**

```
Entry:        April 11, $47.23 (1,286 shares = $60,782)
Exit:         April 28, $65.89 (all shares)

Profit:       $24,011
Return:       +39.4% in 17 days
Risk taken:   $2,250 (stop at $45.48)
Actual risk:  $0 (never hit stop)
Risk/reward:  1 to 10.7 (risked $2,250, made $24,011)
```

**Why Exit at $65.89:**
1. **Thesis complete**: Bounce from support confirmed, earnings positive
2. **Risk/reward shifted**: Position is now 40% gain, further upside requires additional risk
3. **Swing trade complete**: Originally planned 3-week hold, this is 17 days
4. **Pattern complete**: Inverse H&S pattern played out, follow-through achieved
5. **Capital recycling**: Profits should be redeployed to next high-probability trade

---

## Part 4: Trade Analysis and Lessons

### The Perfect Trade Execution

**Why This Trade Worked:**

1. **Entry Signal Was Clear**
   - Defined technical pattern (inverse H&S)
   - Support level tested and confirmed
   - RSI oversold and recovering
   - Risk clearly defined at $45.48

2. **Risk Management Was Strict**
   - Position size matched risk tolerance (3%)
   - Stop loss non-negotiable
   - Profit targets predetermined
   - Exit plan decided before entry

3. **Catalyst Aligned With Pattern**
   - Earnings coming in 16 days
   - Time window matched bounce anticipation
   - Company business improving (real catalyst, not just technicals)
   - Risk/reward improved as stock moved higher

4. **Patience and Discipline**
   - Didn't panic-sell on any pullback
   - Let winners run but took profits
   - Didn't hold through earnings (binary event)
   - Exited at planned target

### Key Technical Levels That Mattered

**Support Levels (Stops):**
```
Primary: $45.48 (tested March 4, 12, April 11)
Secondary: $42.15 (March crash low)
Tertiary: $40.00 (psychological round)
```

**Resistance Levels (Targets):**
```
First: $50.20 (50-day MA)
Second: $52.80 (200-day MA)
Third: $56.00 (50% retracement of IPO drop)
Fourth: $60.00 (psychological, round number)
```

**Actual Path:**
- Entry: $47.23
- First target $50.20: Hit April 13 ✓
- Second target $52.80: Hit April 17 ✓
- Third target $56.00: Hit April 19 ✓
- Fourth target $60.00: Hit April 25 ✓
- Final exit: $65.89 (new high from IPO pop)

Every level acted as predicted by technical analysis.

### The Psychology of This Trade

**Why James Didn't Second-Guess Himself:**

1. **Clear entry condition**: Pattern was obvious, RSI confirmed, support tested
2. **Fixed stop loss**: Knew max loss before entry
3. **Predetermined profit targets**: Didn't have to decide "where to sell" during price moves
4. **Catalyst clarity**: Earnings timing gave definite time window
5. **Trend confirmation**: Each level broken confirmed strategy

**Common mistakes James avoided:**
- ❌ Didn't move stop loss down when stock bounced (let profits ride)
- ❌ Didn't hold through earnings (known binary risk)
- ❌ Didn't chase on FOMO when stock gap-up
- ❌ Didn't try to "squeeze" more on pullbacks
- ✓ Exited at predetermined price target

### Position Sizing: The Unsung Hero

James's position sizing made this trade safe:

```
Account: $75,000
Risk per trade: 3% = $2,250
Position size: Risk / Stop distance
             = $2,250 / $1.75
             = 1,286 shares
Capital used: 1,286 × $47.23 = $60,782 (81% of account)
Remaining: $14,218 (for margin requirement + cash)
```

**Why this size worked:**
- If stopped out: Only lose $2,250 (3%), recoverable
- If he held wrong position for 2 weeks: Could handle it
- Position large enough to make the trade worthwhile
- Small enough to not hurt account if it failed

**Contrast: What if he sized wrong?**

```
Scenario A: Smaller position (1/10th size)
- 128 shares
- Cost: $6,078
- Profit at $65.89: $2,401
- Return: 39.4% but absolute dollars low
- Downside: Doesn't justify the concentration

Scenario B: Larger position (2x size)
- 2,572 shares
- Cost: $121,563 (160% of account, high leverage)
- Stop loss at $45.48: Risk $5,500 (7% of account)
- If stopped: Account down 7%, harder to recover
- If wrong again: Gets wiped out
- Downside: Outsized risk

Scenario C: Actual sizing
- 1,286 shares
- Cost: $60,782 (81% of account)
- Risk: $2,250 (3% of account)
- If stopped: Easy to recover
- Profit: $24,011 (32% of account)
- Upside: Proper risk/reward
```

James's actual sizing was perfect. Not too big, not too small.

## Lessons for Your Trading

### Lesson 1: Pattern Recognition Must Be Precise
The inverse head and shoulders pattern was textbook:
- Both shoulders at similar levels
- Head clearly lower
- Neckline as entry trigger
- Volume confirmation

Before you enter a technical trade, ask:
- [ ] Can I describe the pattern to someone else clearly?
- [ ] Does price confirm at each support level?
- [ ] Is volume aligned (declining on selling, rising on buying)?
- [ ] Can I define the stop loss based on the pattern?

### Lesson 2: Stop Losses Aren't Optional
James set his stop at $45.48 BEFORE entering. He never moved it.
- Entry: $47.23
- Stop: $45.48 (3.7% below entry)
- If stopped, knows loss is $2,250 (3% of account)
- Stops losses aren't "loss," they're "max-loss-definition"

Your rule: Every trade needs a stop loss defined BEFORE entry.

### Lesson 3: Scaling Out Locks In Wins
James's actual strategy (revised):
- Hold 100% until first target ($50.20)
- Sell 30% there to lock in profits
- Hold 70% until $60
- Sell 50% at $60 to lock in more
- Hold 20% for the "home run"

This strategy:
- Guarantees you keep some profits
- Lets you participate in larger moves
- Reduces emotional pressure
- Provides certainty

### Lesson 4: Catalysts Shorten Timeframe
Without earnings on April 27, this could have been a multi-month hold.
WITH earnings coming:
- Time window compressed to 16 days
- Binary risk defined (beat or miss)
- Exit plan straightforward (sell before announcement)
- Position sizing stayed the same but context changed

When trading catalysts:
- Know the date
- Don't hold through if your thesis is just "earnings bounce"
- Move quickly in the days before the event

### Lesson 5: The 10:1 Risk/Reward This Trade Achieved

```
Risk: $2,250 (defined stop)
Reward: $24,011 (actual gain)
Ratio: 10.7:1

This is not average. Most trades aim for 2:1 or 3:1.
How did James get 10.7:1?

1. Sized correctly (not too big, not too small)
2. Pattern was right (sure signal for bounce)
3. Catalyst was coming (defined upside event)
4. Timing was right (bounce right after support tested)
5. No whipsaws (price never went below entry after entry)
6. Held until pattern completed (didn't bail early)
```

The 10:1 ratio was possible but not guaranteed. If he'd:
- Been stopped out: -3% (lost $2,250)
- Been wrong early: -5% (could have happened)

His risk/reward was 1:10.7 because EVERYTHING lined up. That's rare.

## Questions for Reflection

### On Technical Analysis
1. **Can you identify chart patterns like inverse H&S?**
2. **Do you know support/resistance levels for your holdings?**
3. **What does RSI overbought/oversold tell you about entry timing?**
4. **How would you identify the $45.48 support level before it was tested?**

### On Risk Management
5. **Would you have risked $2,250 on a 3-week trade?**
6. **How much of your account should be at risk per trade?**
7. **What's your stop loss policy for swing trades vs. long-term holds?**
8. **How do you decide position size based on stop distance?**

### On Catalyst Trading
9. **How do you find earnings announcement dates?**
10. **Would you hold through earnings or exit before?**
11. **How does catalyst timing affect position sizing?**

### On Your Own Trades

## Replicating This Trade in Your Account

### The Trading Checklist

Before you enter any swing trade:

- [ ] **Pattern**: Clear technical pattern identified (H&S, cup & handle, etc.)
- [ ] **Support**: Price tested support level and bounced
- [ ] **RSI**: RSI below 40 or above 60, showing momentum
- [ ] **Volume**: Volume increasing on bounce, not declining
- [ ] **Stop**: Stop loss defined within 3-5% of entry
- [ ] **Catalyst**: News, earnings, or event in next 2-4 weeks
- [ ] **Risk/Reward**: Potential gain is at least 2x the potential loss
- [ ] **Sizing**: Position size is 1-3% of account max
- [ ] **Targets**: Profit targets defined before entry
- [ ] **Discipline**: Promise to yourself you won't move the stop loss

If you check all 10 boxes, your trade has James's qualities.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Perfect execution beats perfect timing** - James didn't catch the exact bottom, but patience and the pattern did
2. **Risk management makes you sleep at night** - With a defined stop, James could confidently hold through volatility
3. **Catalyst + Pattern + Entry = Success** - All three together create high probability trades
4. **Scale out of winners** - Locking in profits early reduces stress and locks in gains
5. **Stop losses aren't optional** - They define your maximum loss, which must be sized correctly for your account
6. **Technical analysis works when pattern is precise** - Inverse H&S, RSI confirmation, volume alignment all confirmed
7. **Swing trading takes discipline, not intelligence** - James followed a system, not a feeling
8. **Position sizing is underrated** - 1,286 shares was the difference between a great trade and a dangerous one
