- Pros: Reduced risk
- Cons: More work

```

### Recommended Starting Allocation

For a beginner with $10,000:
```
$5,000 - SPY (Broad S&P 500 index) - CORE
$2,000 - Tech stock (MSFT, AAPL, or NVDA) - GROWTH
$1,500 - Dividend stock (JNJ, PG, KO) - INCOME
$1,000 - Cash reserve - SAFETY
$500 - Available for "opportunities"
```

### Your First Decisions

**Decision 1A: Start with SPY**
```
Time: April 1, 9:35 AM
Price of SPY: $529.70
Quantity to buy: $5,000 / $529.70 = 9.44 shares (round to 9 shares)
Cost: 9 × $529.70 = $4,767.30
Cash remaining: $10,000 - $4,767.30 = $5,232.70
```

**Question**: Do you think starting with index fund is right? (Yes/No)

**Decision 1B: Pick a Tech Stock**

You review 3 options:
- MSFT: $425, large cap, safe, growing
- NVDA: $875, AI play, high growth, more volatile
- AAPL: $190, huge company, stable, pays dividend

Your research:
- MSFT: Solid company, reasonable valuation, good balance
- NVDA: Everyone's buying this (AI boom), but at what price?
- AAPL: Boring but reliable, good track record

**Which do you pick and why?** _______________

**Recommended**: MSFT (balanced choice)
```
Time: April 1, 10:15 AM
Price of MSFT: $425.20
Quantity to buy: $2,000 / $425.20 = 4.70 shares (round to 4 shares)
Cost: 4 × $425.20 = $1,700.80
Cash remaining: $5,232.70 - $1,700.80 = $3,531.90
Stop loss: $404 (5% below entry) - WRITE THIS DOWN
Profit target: $552 (30% above entry) - WRITE THIS DOWN
```

**Decision 1C: Pick a Dividend Stock**

Options:
- JNJ: $158, pharma, 2.8% yield, very stable
- KO: $62, beverages, 3.1% yield, very stable
- PG: $168, consumer goods, 2.9% yield, very stable

All are good. Pick the one you like:

**Which do you pick?** _______________

**Recommended**: KO (lower price, easier to understand)
```
Time: April 1, 11:00 AM
Price of KO: $62.35
Quantity to buy: $1,500 / $62.35 = 24.04 shares (round to 24 shares)
Cost: 24 × $62.35 = $1,496.40
Cash remaining: $3,531.90 - $1,496.40 = $2,035.50
Stop loss: $59.2 (5% below entry)
Profit target: $81 (30% above entry)
```

## Week 9-10: The Volatility Test (May 27 - June 9, 2024)

### Market Scenario
Fed announces it might raise rates again. Market sells off.

```
Monday (June 3):   Market down 2.5%
Tuesday (June 4):  Market down 1% more
Portfolio down 3.5% in two days!
```

### Your Portfolio
```
SPY: $562 → $546 (-2.8%) | Value: $4,914
MSFT: $455 → $444 (-2.4%) | Value: $1,776

You're down $700 from peak.
```

### Your Psychology Test

**You check your phone and see the decline.**

What goes through your mind?

Option A: "Oh no, I bought at the top, I should sell everything"
Option B: "This is a buying opportunity, I should add"
Option C: "This is normal volatility, I'll hold"
Option D: "I should check if any stop losses hit"

**What do you do?** _______________

**Recommended**: Option D, then C
- Check stop losses (none hit, declines are only 2-3%)
- Hold your positions (you planned for 5-10% declines)
- Keep your cash (don't add at uncertainty)
- Check back next week

### The Recovery (Week 10)

```
Wednesday (June 5): Market bounces +1%

## Lessons from Your First Portfolio

### Lesson 1: Discipline Beats Emotion
- You had a plan at the start (buy SPY, MSFT, KO)
- You stuck to it even when markets dipped
- Result: Small but consistent gain

If you had panic-sold on June 3, you'd be down 3.8%. Instead you're up 6.86%.

### Lesson 2: Diversification Protects You
Your 4 positions allowed you to:
- Get broad market (SPY)
- Pick winners (MSFT)
- Get income (KO)
- Add diversity (Healthcare)

If you'd put all $10,000 in MSFT, your return would be +8.2% (better!). But if MSFT had crashed, you'd lose more too.

Diversification = safety + consistent returns.

### Lesson 3: Cash is a Position
Your $1,000 cash reserve:
- Let you sleep at night
- Prevented forced selling
- Would have let you buy a crash (if one happened)
- Is boring but valuable

Many new investors get this wrong. Cash feels "wasteful" but it's actually strategic.

### Lesson 4: Your Rules Worked
You wrote down 8 rules at the start. Did they help?

- Rule 1 (20% max per position): Kept you from overleveraging
- Rule 2 (Stop loss): Gave you an exit plan (never triggered)
- Rule 3 (5 positions max): Kept it simple
- Rule 4 (Sell 50% at +30%): Didn't trigger, but would have locked profits
- Rule 5 (Sell at -15%): Provided safety net (never triggered)
- Rule 6 (Weekly not daily): Kept you from overtrading
- Rule 7 (No margin): Kept you safe
- Rule 8 (10% cash): Gave you flexibility

**Lesson**: Having rules and following them beats trying to time the market.

### Lesson 5: Time and Patience
12 weeks is 3 months. Your 6.86% return is annualized to:
- 6.86% × 4 = ~27% annualized

That's excellent. But you made it by:
- Being patient
- Not trading much (only initial entry)
- Holding through volatility
- Following your plan

This is how wealth is built. Not exciting, but reliable.

## What Comes Next?

### If You Did Well (Gained 5%+)
- Congratulations, you learned the fundamentals
- Consider running scenario 06 (single stock trade)
- Then move to scenario 02 (volatility management)

### If You Lost Money (Down 5%+)
- Don't worry, learning from losses is valuable
- Review your decisions
- Understand what went wrong:
  - Did you panic sell?
  - Did you overtrade?
  - Did you ignore your rules?
- Try scenario 01 again with a different approach

### If You Broke Even
- You learned about volatility (that's valuable)
- Try again but with slightly more aggressive positions
- Or try scenario 01 again during a different market period
