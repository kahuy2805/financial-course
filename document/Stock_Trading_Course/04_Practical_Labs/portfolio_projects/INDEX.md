# Portfolio Projects - Build Real Portfolios for Real Goals

## Overview

Portfolio Projects are structured exercises where you build complete portfolios designed for specific goals and risk profiles. Unlike simulations (which test decisions), portfolio projects teach construction, rebalancing, and management for different investor types.

These are templates you can actually use for your real money.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I modify the allocation?**
A: Yes! Use it as a template. But keep the overall structure.

**Q: What if I disagree with a holding?**
A: Swap it for similar sector/type holding. Example: Don't like JNJ? Use PG instead.

**Q: How often should I rebalance?**
A: Quarterly is standard. Monthly if you have time. Annually minimum.

**Q: What if market crashes?**
A: Hold your rebalancing schedule. Rebalance when out of balance.

**Q: Should I reinvest dividends?**
A: Yes, unless you need the income. Reinvestment compounds growth.

**Q: Is this a "set it and forget it" strategy?**
A: For conservative/balanced portfolios, mostly yes. For trading portfolio, no.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Compare your return to the target. If conservative and up 6%, you're winning. If aggressive and down 5%, you're losing.

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start With What You Know
If you only know tech stocks, don't force yourself into income stocks. Start conservative/tech-focused, then diversify.

### Tip 2: Automate Everything
Set up automatic rebalancing alerts. Don't rely on yourself to remember.

### Tip 3: Reinvest Dividends
Unless you need the income, always reinvest. Compounding is magical.

### Tip 4: Rebalance Quarterly
But don't over-rebalance. Check quarterly, act if needed.

### Tip 5: Review Annually
Each year, check if you should adjust. Especially if circumstances change.

## Adjustments for Life Events

**Got a raise?** → Increase contributions, not allocation change

**Getting married?** → Might shift from aggressive to balanced

**Having a kid?** → Might shift to more conservative

**Getting close to retirement?** → Shift from aggressive to conservative over 5 years

**Lost job?** → Increase cash buffer, don't change allocation

**Retirement approaching?** → Start shifting: Aggressive (20 years away) → Balanced (10 years) → Conservative (5 years) → Income (at retirement)
