## Overview

Chart patterns are visual formations on price charts that repeat regularly and predict future price movement. In this lesson, you'll learn the most common and reliable patterns: Head and Shoulders, Double Tops, Double Bottoms, and Triangles. These patterns are used by professional traders worldwide because they work consistently.

**Time to complete:** 25-30 minutes

### What Are Chart Patterns?

**Chart patterns** are distinctive shapes formed by price action that appear repeatedly and predict future movement.

**Simple Analogy:**
Think of weather patterns. Low pressure systems typically bring rain. You see the pattern on a weather map and predict rain. Chart patterns work similarly - when you see the pattern, you can predict the likely price move.

### Why Chart Patterns Work

**Reason 1: Trader Psychology**
When traders see a pattern they recognize, they act the same way. This collective action creates predictable outcomes.

**Reason 2: Historical Repetition**
These patterns have repeated thousands of times over decades. Professionals trust them because they work.

**Reason 3: Institutional Programs**
Large funds have algorithms that recognize these patterns. Automated buying/selling at pattern completion creates reliable moves.

## Pattern 1: Head and Shoulders (Reversal Pattern)

### What is Head and Shoulders?

**Head and Shoulders** is a reversal pattern that signals the end of an uptrend and the beginning of a downtrend.

### Visual Pattern

```
                LEFT      HEAD      RIGHT
              SHOULDER  (PEAK)    SHOULDER
                 ╱╲       ╱╲       ╱╲
                ╱  ╲     ╱  ╲     ╱  ╲
               ╱    ╲   ╱    ╲   ╱    ╲
              ╱      ╲╱      ╲╱      ╲
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   │          │      │      │      │      │
   NECKLINE ──────────────────────────────────
   │
   Resistance turning into support... then breaks below!

   Price target = Neckline - (Head height)
```

### How to Identify Head and Shoulders

**Step 1: Look for the Structure**
- Stock makes a peak (left shoulder)
- Falls and bounces to a HIGHER peak (head)
- Falls again and bounces to a LOWER peak (right shoulder)
- Creates a valley at the bottom (neckline)

**Step 2: Draw the Neckline**
Draw a horizontal (or slightly sloped) line through the valleys.

**Step 3: Watch for the Breakdown**
When price breaks BELOW the neckline, the pattern is confirmed.

### Example: Real Head and Shoulders

```
Price  $150                       HEAD
       $145  LEFT      ╱╲       ╱╲    RIGHT
       $140  SHOULDER ╱  ╲     ╱  ╲  SHOULDER
       $135         ╱    ╲   ╱    ╲╱
       $130  ══════════════╲════════════
       $125  NECKLINE      ╲
       $120                 ╲ ← BREAKDOWN below neckline
       $115                  ╲ = SELL SIGNAL!
             Day 1  5  10  15  20  25

Measurements:
Head height: $145 - $130 = $15
Expected drop below neckline: $15
Price target: $130 - $15 = $115
```

### Trading Head and Shoulders

**Entry Signal:** Price breaks below neckline
**Stop Loss:** Above the right shoulder (above $140 in example)
**Profit Target:** Neckline minus head height
**Risk/Reward:** Usually 1:2 to 1:3

---

## Pattern 2: Double Top (Reversal Pattern)

### What is Double Top?

**Double Top** looks like the letter "M". It signals that sellers have rejected price at this level twice, and a downtrend is likely coming.

### Visual Pattern

```
                PEAK 1              PEAK 2
                ╱╲                  ╱╲
               ╱  ╲                ╱  ╲
              ╱    ╲              ╱    ╲
             ╱      ╲            ╱      ╲
            ╱        ╲          ╱        ╲ ← Price falls
           ╱          ╲        ╱          ╲
          ╱            ╲╱╲    ╱            ╲
         ╱              VALLEY               ╲
        ╱                                     ╲
       ════════════════════════════════════════ SUPPORT (neckline)
       │                                      │
       Double Top = Sellers WIN TWICE at this price
```

### How to Identify Double Top

**Step 1: Find Two Peaks**
- Stock rises to $150 (Peak 1)
- Falls to $140
- Rises again to $150 (Peak 2, same height or slightly lower)

**Step 2: Identify the Valley**
The bottom between the two peaks is the neckline.

**Step 3: Wait for Breakdown**
When price breaks below the neckline, the pattern is confirmed.

### Example: Real Double Top

```
Price  $155
       $150  PEAK1                 PEAK2
       $145   ╱╲                    ╱╲
       $140  ╱  ╲════╱╲════════════╱  ╲
       $135 ╱    ╲  VALLEY      ╱     ╲
       $130════════╲════════════╱═════════ NECKLINE
       $125         └─────────────┘
       $120                        ↓ Breakdown = SELL SIGNAL
             Day 1  5  10  15  20  25

Pattern interpretation:
- Sellers rejected $150 twice
- Each rejection (peak) = Selling pressure
- Breakdown below $130 = Pattern completion
- Price target: $130 - ($150-$130) = $110
```

### Trading Double Top

**Entry Signal:** Price breaks below neckline
**Stop Loss:** Above the higher peak
**Profit Target:** Neckline minus peak height
**Pattern Type:** Reversal (uptrend to downtrend)

---

## Pattern 3: Double Bottom (Reversal Pattern)

### What is Double Bottom?

**Double Bottom** looks like the letter "W". It signals that buyers have defended a price level twice, and an uptrend is likely coming.

### Visual Pattern

```
        ╱╲            ╱╲
       ╱  ╲          ╱  ╲
      ╱    ╲        ╱    ╲
     ╱      ╲      ╱      ╲
    ╱        ╲    ╱        ╲
   ╱          ╲╱╲           ╲
  ╱            VALLEY 1      ╲      ← Stock bounces at same low twice
                VALLEY 2      ╲
                               ↑
════════════════════════════════════ SUPPORT (baseline)
```

### How to Identify Double Bottom

**Step 1: Find Two Lows**
- Stock falls to $100 (Bottom 1)
- Rises to $110
- Falls again to $100 (Bottom 2, same level)

**Step 2: Identify the Peak Between**
The high between the two lows is the neckline/resistance.

**Step 3: Wait for Breakout**
When price breaks ABOVE the neckline, the pattern is confirmed.

### Example: Real Double Bottom

```
Price  $130
       $125                           ↑ Breakout = BUY SIGNAL
       $120  ════════════════════════════ NECKLINE/RESISTANCE
       $115  ╱╲            ╱╲
       $110 ╱  ╲════════╱  ╲
       $105╱    PEAK    ╲    ╲
       $100  VALLEY1    VALLEY2
       $ 95
             Day 1  5  10  15  20  25

Pattern interpretation:
- Buyers defended $100 twice (two bounces from this level)
- Each bounce = Buying pressure appearing
- Breakout above $120 = Pattern completion
- Price target: $120 + ($120-$100) = $140
```

### Trading Double Bottom

**Entry Signal:** Price breaks above neckline
**Stop Loss:** Below the lower low
**Profit Target:** Neckline plus bottom depth
**Pattern Type:** Reversal (downtrend to uptrend)

---

## Pattern 4: Triangle (Continuation Pattern)

### What is Triangle?

**Triangle** shows price bouncing in an increasingly narrow range. It indicates price is building energy for a big move (either direction).

### Visual Pattern - Symmetric Triangle

```
           ╱╲              ← Resistance line (falling)
          ╱  ╲
         ╱    ╲
        ╱      ╲
       ╱        ╲╱╲
      ╱          ╲  ╲     ← Support line (rising)
     ╱            ╲   ╲
    ╱              ╲    ╲
   ╱                ╲     ├─→ BREAKOUT (could be up or down)
  ═══════════════════════════

Converging lines = Building pressure
Eventually: Breakout in either direction (usually up)
```

### How to Identify Triangle

**Step 1: Find Converging Lines**
- Draw a line connecting the falling highs (resistance)
- Draw a line connecting the rising lows (support)
- Lines should converge toward a point

**Step 2: Measure the Triangle**
- Height of triangle at start = price range
- This range will be the price move AFTER breakout

**Step 3: Wait for Breakout**
Price will eventually break out of the triangle.

### Example: Real Triangle

```
Price  $120  ╱╲
       $118 ╱  ╲
       $116╱    ╲╱╲
       $114      ╱  ╲
       $112           ╲╱╲
       $110  ═══════════  ╲
       $108                ╱──→ Breakout!
             Day 1  5  10  15  20

Triangle shows:
- Price bouncing between $110-$120 range
- Range is tightening (converging)
- Price building pressure
- When breakout comes, it will be fast
```

### Trading Triangle

**Entry Signal:** Price breaks out of the triangle (either direction)
**Stop Loss:** Inside the triangle (opposite direction)
**Profit Target:** Triangle height × 2 (usually)
**Pattern Type:** Continuation (breakout in direction of prior trend)

## Summary of Main Patterns

| Pattern | Shape | What It Means | Trade | Target |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|--------|
| Head & Shoulders | M shape | Uptrend ending | SELL at breakdown | Neckline - head height |
| Double Top | M shape | Resistance twice | SELL at breakdown | Neckline - peak height |
| Double Bottom | W shape | Support twice | BUY at breakout | Neckline + valley depth |
| Triangle | V shape tightening | Building pressure | BREAKOUT (either direction) | Triangle height |

---

## Pattern Reliability and Confirmation

### What Makes Patterns More Reliable?

**1. Higher Volume at Pattern Completion**

```
Good: Triangle breaks out on 5x normal volume
Bad: Triangle breaks out on low volume

High volume = More conviction = More likely to work
```

**2. Multiple Timeframe Confirmation**

```
Good: Pattern appears on daily AND 4-hour chart
Bad: Pattern only on 1-hour chart

Larger timeframes = More reliable patterns
```

**3. Larger Patterns**

```
Good: Double Top formed over 2 months
Bad: Double Top formed over 2 days

Longer formation = More people aware of pattern = More reliable
```

### Pattern Success Rates

Professional traders report these approximate success rates:

**Head and Shoulders:** 90% (very reliable)
**Double Top/Bottom:** 85% (very reliable)
**Triangle:** 80% (reliable)

These high success rates are why professionals trade patterns.

## Real-World Application

### Scenario 1: Identifying a Double Top

**What You See:**
Apple (AAPL) chart:
- Rises to $150 (Peak 1)
- Falls to $140
- Rises to $150 again (Peak 2)
- Support at $140 (neckline)

**Your Analysis:**
This looks like a double top formation.

**Your Preparation:**
- Set SELL alert at $139 (below neckline)
- Set stop loss at $152 (above peaks)
- Set profit target at $130 ($140 neckline minus $10 peak distance)

**When It Breaks:**
Price breaks below $140 on high volume.

**Your Action:**
SELL 100 shares at $138-139
Stop loss: $152
Target: $130

**Result:** If target hit, you profit $8-9 per share.

### Scenario 2: Trading a Triangle Breakout

**What You See:**
Tesla (TSLA) in a triangle:
- High: $200
- Low: $190
- Range: $10
- Pattern formed over 1 week

**Your Observation:**
Triangle narrowing. Pressure building.

**Your Setup:**
- Watch for breakout above $200 or below $190
- On breakout: Will be fast move
- Profit target: Triangle height ($10) × 2 = $20 move expected

**When Breakout Happens:**
Price breaks ABOVE $200 on heavy volume.

**Your Trade:**
BUY above $200 at $200.50
Stop loss: $189 (below triangle)
Target: $220.50 (breakout point + $20)

**Result:** Fast $20+ move when triangle breaks.

### Scenario 3: Head and Shoulders Confirmation

**What You See:**
Stock in strong uptrend. Creates:
- Left shoulder: $145
- Head: $155 (peak)
- Right shoulder: $145 (lower peak)
- Neckline: $135

**Your Recognition:**
Classic head and shoulders reversal pattern.

**Pattern Quality Check:**
- Volume? ✓ (heavy volume on right shoulder)
- Multiple timeframes? ✓ (appears on daily and 4-hour)
- Large formation? ✓ (formed over 3 weeks)

**Your Decision:**
This is a HIGH-QUALITY pattern. Worth trading.

**Your Trade Setup:**
- Alert: If price breaks below $134
- Entry: SELL/Short at $133
- Stop: $148 (above right shoulder)
- Target: $130 minus ($155-$135) = $110

**Expected Outcome:**
Pattern success rate: 90% (very high confidence)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Trading Incomplete Patterns

**What Traders Do Wrong:**
"I see a double top forming. I'll short it NOW before it completes."

**Why It's Wrong:**
Pattern isn't confirmed until price breaks the neckline. Shorting too early = higher risk.

**The Right Way:**
Wait for the breakdown BELOW neckline before entering.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Volume on Pattern Completion

**Reality:** A pattern that breaks on low volume often fails.

Always check: Did volume INCREASE on the breakout?

### Mistake #3: Not Measuring the Pattern Correctly

**What Traders Do Wrong:**
"Double top is at $150. I'll set target at $130 (arbitrary choice)."

**Why It's Wrong:**
You're not using the pattern's geometry.

**The Right Way:**
Measure the peak-to-neckline distance and use that to set targets.

### Mistake #4: Trading Patterns on Very Short Timeframes

**Reality:** Patterns on 1-minute charts are noise. Use at least 15-minute charts, preferably hourly or daily.

### Mistake #5: Forcing Patterns That Don't Exist

**What Traders Do Wrong:**
"This could be a double top if I squint hard enough."

**Reality:** Real patterns are OBVIOUS. If you have to force it, it's not a valid pattern.

## Quick Review

**Chart Patterns:**

**Head and Shoulders (Reversal):**
- M-shape pattern (left shoulder, head, right shoulder)
- Signals: Uptrend ending, downtrend coming
- Trade: SELL on breakdown below neckline
- Success rate: 90%

**Double Top (Reversal):**
- M-shape, simpler than head/shoulders
- Signals: Resistance tested twice, breakdown coming
- Trade: SELL on breakdown below neckline
- Success rate: 85%

**Double Bottom (Reversal):**
- W-shape pattern
- Signals: Support tested twice, breakout coming
- Trade: BUY on breakout above neckline
- Success rate: 85%

**Triangle (Continuation):**
- Converging lines, narrowing range
- Signals: Pressure building, breakout coming (usually up)
- Trade: BUY/SELL on breakout
- Success rate: 80%

**Key Principles:**
1. Patterns must be clearly visible (not forced)
2. Volume should INCREASE on pattern completion
3. Larger patterns (longer formation) = More reliable
4. Use multiple timeframes for confirmation
5. Always use stop losses

---

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Pattern Identification

Look at a daily chart of 5 different stocks.

For each stock, find:
1. Is there a chart pattern visible? (Which one?)
2. Is it complete or still forming?
3. If complete, did volume confirm it?
4. Would you trade this pattern? (Why/why not)

### Exercise 2: Double Top Setup

Find a stock with a completed double top pattern (price broke neckline).

1. Where were the two peaks?
2. What was the neckline level?
3. What was the breakdown (how far did price fall)?
4. What would have been your profit target?
5. Did the target get hit?

### Exercise 3: Triangle Prediction

Find a stock forming a triangle.

1. When did the triangle start?
2. What's the height of the triangle?
3. Where are the converging support/resistance lines?
4. When will it break (guess)?
5. Which direction do you think it will break?

### Exercise 4: Multi-Timeframe Pattern Confirmation

Find a pattern on a daily chart.

Now check:
1. Is the same pattern visible on 4-hour chart? (YES/NO)
2. Is it visible on 1-hour chart? (YES/NO)
3. How confident are you in this pattern? (Rate 1-10)
4. Would you increase your position size if multiple timeframes confirm?

### Exercise 5: Pattern History Research

Pick a stock that showed a chart pattern in the past.

Research:
1. When did the pattern form?
2. What did technical traders predict would happen?
3. What actually happened?
4. Did the pattern work or fail?
5. What was the percentage move?
