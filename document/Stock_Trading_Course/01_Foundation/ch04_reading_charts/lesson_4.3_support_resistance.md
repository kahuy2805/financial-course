## Overview

Support and resistance are perhaps the most important concept in technical analysis. They're price levels where stocks tend to bounce (support) or reverse (resistance). In this lesson, you'll learn to identify these levels on any chart, understand the psychology behind them, and use them to make better trading decisions.

**Time to complete:** 20-25 minutes

### What is Support and Resistance?

**Support:** A price level where stock tends to BOUNCE UP (buyers push back)
**Resistance:** A price level where stock tends to BOUNCE DOWN (sellers push back)

**Simple Analogy:**

Think of a ball bouncing:
```
        ← Resistance (ceiling where ball bounces down)

    ↗↙  ↗↙  ↗↙  ← Bouncing between two levels

        ← Support (floor where ball bounces up)
```

The ball bounces between support and resistance, just like stock prices.

### The Psychology Behind Support and Resistance

Support and resistance exist because of human psychology and collective memory.

#### Why Support Exists

**Imagine:**
Stock falls from $150 to $145. Many traders bought at $145, thinking "it's a good price."

**What Happens Next:**
When price returns to $145, those traders decide:
- "This is a good buying opportunity again" → BUY
- Or: "I want to sell the losing shares I bought before" → Sellers appear but are overwhelmed by buyers

**The Result:**
Buying pressure at $145 stops the decline. The stock bounces UP from support.

**Real Example:**
```
Price at $150 ──────────────► Stock falls from $150
                              ↓
Price at $145 ◄──────────────► Buyers remember: "I bought here before"
                              ↑
                    Stock bounces UP from $145
```

#### Why Resistance Exists

**Imagine:**
Stock rises from $145 to $150. Many traders who bought at $150 are now underwater.

**What Happens Next:**
When price returns to $150, those sellers think:
- "I'm breaking even! Let me sell!" → Heavy selling at $150
- New buyers see price isn't going higher → They wait

**The Result:**
Selling pressure at $150 stops the advance. The stock bounces DOWN from resistance.

**Real Example:**
```
Price at $150 ◄──────────────► Sellers remember: "I bought here before (now even)"
                              ↑
                    Stock bounces DOWN from $150
                              ↓
Price at $145 ──────────────► Stock falls back to $145
```

### How Support and Resistance Work Together

Most of the time, stock bounces between support and resistance:

```
          Price
          $150  ═══════════════════ RESISTANCE
          $148      ╱╲    ╱╲
          $146     ╱  ╲  ╱  ╲
          $144    ╱    ╱╲    ╲
          $142   ╱          ╲   ╲╱
          $145  ═══════════════════ SUPPORT

          Stock bounces between $145-$150 many times
```

Traders profit by:
- **Buying at support** (expect bounce up)
- **Selling at resistance** (expect bounce down)

This can happen dozens of times before price finally breaks out.

## Identifying Support and Resistance

### Method 1: Look for Horizontal Price Levels (Easiest)

**What to Look For:**
Places where the stock price has:
1. Bounced up multiple times (support)
2. Bounced down multiple times (resistance)

**Visual Example - Finding Support:**

```
Price History (last month):
Price   ─────────────────────────────────────────
$150    │         ╱╲         ╱╲
$148    │        ╱  ╲       ╱  ╲
$146    │       ╱    ╲     ╱    ╲
$144    │      ╱      ╲   ╱      ╲
$145    │─────────────────────────── ← Support level
$143    │      ╱        ╲ ╱
        │
Days    1     5     10      15     20     25

Analysis: Stock bounced UP from $145 exactly 3 times.
Conclusion: $145 is support (buyers step in here)
```

**Visual Example - Finding Resistance:**

```
Price History (last month):
Price   ─────────────────────────────────────────
$155    │  ╱╲         ╱╲
$153    │ ╱  ╲       ╱  ╲
$151    │╱    ╲     ╱    ╲
$150    │─────────────────────────── ← Resistance level
$149    │      ╲   ╱      ╲   ╱
$147    │       ╲ ╱        ╲ ╱
        │
Days    1     5     10      15     20     25

Analysis: Stock bounced DOWN from $150 exactly 3 times.
Conclusion: $150 is resistance (sellers step in here)
```

### Method 2: Previous Price Levels

Stock that previously was support often becomes resistance, and vice versa.

**Example:**

```
Price $100 ─────────────────── Support (bounced up 2x)

      (Stock breaks through and rises to $110)

Price $100 ─────────────────── Now acts as Resistance!
                              (bounces down from here)

      (Stock rises to $115 then falls)

Price $110 ─────────────────── Now acts as Support!
                              (bounced up from here)
```

**Key Rule:** "Broken support becomes resistance; broken resistance becomes support"

This is one of the most reliable principles in technical analysis.

### Method 3: Volume Peaks (Advanced)

Support and resistance are stronger when they coincide with heavy volume.

**Why:**
- Heavy volume = Many traders remember this level
- More trader memory = Stronger reaction

**Example:**
```
Support at $100 with high volume (1 million shares/day) = Very strong support
Support at $100 with low volume (100k shares/day) = Weaker support
```

### Visual Guide: Finding Support and Resistance on a Real Chart

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
Price
$160 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
$158 │                                         │
$156 │      ╱╲               ╱╲               │ ← Has bounce up 2x
$154 │     ╱  ╲             ╱  ╲              │
$152 │    ╱    ╲           ╱    ╲             │
$150 │───────────╲─────────╱──────────────────│ ← SUPPORT (bounces up here)
$148 │           ╲       ╱                    │
$146 │            ╲     ╱                     │
$140 └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
     Week1 Week2 Week3 Week4 Week5

Step 1: Look for bounces
Step 2: Find price level where bounces occur
Step 3: Draw horizontal line at that level
Step 4: Label it as SUPPORT or RESISTANCE
```

## Multiple Support and Resistance Levels

Most stocks have MULTIPLE support and resistance levels, creating a "staircase" pattern.

```
Price
$200 ════════════════════════════════ Resistance 3
$195
$190 ────────────────────────────────── Resistance 2
$185
$180 ═══════════════════════════════════ Resistance 1
$175
$170 ────────────────────────────────── Support 1
$165
$160 ════════════════════════════════ Support 2
$155
$150 ────────────────────────────────── Support 3
```

Stock gradually moves up, resistance by resistance:
1. Resistance 1 at $180 ← Stock bounces here
2. Resistance 2 at $190 ← Stock bounces here after breaking through $180
3. Resistance 3 at $200 ← Stock meets this next

**Key Insight:**
Traders don't just watch one level. They watch the whole structure.

---

## Strong vs. Weak Support/Resistance

Not all support and resistance levels are equal.

### Factors That Make Support/Resistance Stronger

**1. Multiple Touches**

```
Weak: Stock touched $150 once and bounced
Strong: Stock touched $150 five times and bounced each time
```

**Why:** More touches = more traders remember this level = stronger reaction

**2. Higher Volume**

```
Weak: Support at $100 on 50k share volume
Strong: Support at $100 on 2 million share volume
```

**Why:** Heavy volume means more money and traders at this level

**3. Longer Time Period**

```
Weak: Support formed on 1-day chart (formed yesterday)
Strong: Support formed on daily chart (has held for 3 months)
```

**Why:** Longer history = more traders familiar with it = stronger reaction

**4. Coincidence with Moving Averages or Fibonacci (Advanced)**

```
Weak: Support at random level
Strong: Support where 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average meet
```

**Why:** Multiple technical indicators agreeing = very strong

### Example: Rating Support Strength

**Support Level at $100:**

| Characteristic | Rating |
|---|---|
| Touched 2 times | Weak |
| Touched 5 times | Moderate |
| Touched 10 times over 6 months | Strong |
| With high volume | Stronger |
| With moving average | Strongest |

## How Traders Use Support and Resistance

### Use Case 1: Entry Points (Buying at Support)

**Strategy:**
Buy when stock approaches support level.

**Why it works:**
Historically, stock bounces up from support, so you expect upside.

**Visual Example:**

```
Price  $160
$158           ╱╲
$156          ╱  ╲
$154         ╱    ╲        ╱╲
$152        ╱      ╲      ╱  ╲
$150 ─────────────────────────── Support
$148       ╱        ╲    ╱
$146      ╱          ╲  ╱

      BUY HERE ↓ (approaching support)
      Expect bounce up ↑
```

**Real Trade Example:**
- Stock price: $105 (falling toward $100 support)
- Your buy order: Buy at $100.50
- Stop loss: $99 (just below support)
- Target: $110 (next resistance)

### Use Case 2: Exit Points (Selling at Resistance)

**Strategy:**
Sell when stock approaches resistance level.

**Why it works:**
Historically, stock bounces down from resistance, so you expect decline or pullback.

**Visual Example:**

```
Price  $160 ─────────────────────────  Resistance
$158           ╱╲        ╱╲
$156          ╱  ╲      ╱  ╲
$154         ╱    ╲    ╱    ╲
$152        ╱      ╲  ╱      ╲
$150
$148       ╱        ╲╱

      SELL HERE ↑ (approaching resistance)
      Expect bounce down ↓
```

**Real Trade Example:**
- Stock price: $155 (rising toward $160 resistance)
- Your sell order: Sell at $160
- Stop: If breaks above $160, stop loss at $162
- You profit if stock bounces down from $160

### Use Case 3: Stop Loss Placement

**Smart traders place stop losses JUST BEYOND support or resistance.**

**Why:**
If support truly exists, stock shouldn't go below it. If it does, support has broken = position is wrong.

**Visual Example:**

```
Price  $110
$108
$106          YOUR ENTRY
$105 ─────────────────  Support
$104
$103 ✗ STOP LOSS (just below support)

If stock falls below support to $103, stop is hit.
This protects you from bigger losses.
```

### Use Case 4: Profit Taking at Resistance

**Smart traders take profits at resistance.**

**Why:**
Stock likely to bounce down at resistance, so take gains when you can.

**Visual Example:**

```
Price  $150 ─────────────────  Resistance (TAKE PROFIT HERE)
$148
$146
$145 ─────────────────  Support (ENTRY PRICE)
$143
$141

Position: Buy at $145, sell at $150
Profit: $5 per share × number of shares
```

## Real-World Application

### Scenario 1: Identifying Support on a Real Stock

**What You See:**
Apple (AAPL) chart for the last 3 months

**Your Observation:**
```
Price bounced up from $150 on 3 different occasions:
- February 5
- February 18
- March 2

Each time, it bounced up from around $150.
```

**Your Conclusion:**
$150 is likely support for AAPL.

**Your Trading Decision:**
- If AAPL falls to $150, consider buying (expect bounce)
- Set stop loss at $149 (just below support)
- Target: next resistance at $160

### Scenario 2: Resistance Becomes Support

**What You Observe:**
```
Time 1: Stock rises to $200, bounces down (Resistance)
Time 2: Stock falls to $200, bounces up (Support!)
```

**What Happened:**
The old resistance at $200 became support when broken.

**Your Trading Decision:**
- If stock falls to $200, expect bounce
- This level is now very reliable support

### Scenario 3: Multiple Support Levels to Plan Trades

**Stock Situation:**
Microsoft (MSFT) is falling. You see:
- Resistance at $400 (above current price)
- Support at $380
- Support at $350

**Your Trading Plan:**
```
If MSFT falls to $380 → BUY (expect bounce)
   Stop at $375
   Target: $390

If $380 breaks → Support shifts to $350
   At $350 → BUY again (expect bounce)
   Stop at $345
   Target: $365
```

You have multiple entry opportunities.

### Scenario 4: Trading Range (Bouncing Between Levels)

**What You Notice:**
Stock bounces between $100-110 for 3 weeks.

**Your Observation:**
- Support: $100 (bounced up 4 times)
- Resistance: $110 (bounced down 4 times)
- Stock is in a trading range (consolidation)

**Your Trading Strategy:**
```
Buy at support ($100), sell at resistance ($110)
Repeat this 5-6 times while in range

Trade 1: Buy $100 → Sell $110 = +$10 profit
Trade 2: Buy $100 → Sell $110 = +$10 profit
Trade 3: Buy $100 → Sell $110 = +$10 profit
...repeat...
```

This is called "range trading."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Treating Every Bounce as Support/Resistance

**Reality:** Not every bounce point is significant. Look for:
- Multiple touches (at least 2-3)
- Volume confirmation
- Longer timeframe formation

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Timeframe Differences

**Reality:** Support at $100 on 1-hour chart might not be support on daily chart.

**Better Approach:**
- Identify support on daily chart first (most important)
- Use shorter timeframes for entry timing

### Mistake #3: Drawing Support/Resistance Lines Too Precisely

**Reality:** These levels are ZONES, not exact prices.

```
Not: "Support is exactly $100.00"
But: "Support is around $100, roughly $99-101 zone"
```

Stock doesn't bounce from exact penny; it bounces from a zone.

### Mistake #4: Changing Support/Resistance After it Breaks

**What Traders Do Wrong:**
"Support was at $100. Stock fell to $98. Now I'll say support is at $98."

**Why It's Wrong:**
You're just making excuses. The support was at $100; it broke. That's the information - support failed.

**The Right Way:**
Accept that support broke. Find the NEXT support level.

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Volume at Support/Resistance

**Reality:** Support with huge volume is much stronger than support with low volume.

Always check: Is this support level backed by heavy trading volume?

## Quick Review

**Support and Resistance Fundamentals:**

**Support:**
- Price level where stock tends to BOUNCE UP
- Buyers appear and push price back up
- Example: Stock falls to $100, bounces back up

**Resistance:**
- Price level where stock tends to BOUNCE DOWN
- Sellers appear and push price back down
- Example: Stock rises to $150, bounces back down

**Why They Exist:**
- Human psychology and trader memory
- Traders remember past price levels
- Many execute trades at the same level = predictable bounce

**How to Identify:**
1. Look for price levels where stock bounced multiple times
2. Higher touches (3+) = stronger level
3. Higher volume = stronger level
4. Longer time period = stronger level

**Using Support and Resistance:**
- Buy at support (expect bounce up)
- Sell at resistance (expect bounce down)
- Place stops just beyond these levels
- Take profits at these levels

**Key Principle:**
"Support becomes resistance when broken; resistance becomes support when broken"

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Identify Support and Resistance

Look at a daily chart of any stock (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.). Identify:

1. Three support levels (draw horizontal lines)
2. Three resistance levels (draw horizontal lines)
3. How many times has each level been touched?
4. Rate strength of each (weak/moderate/strong)

### Exercise 2: Hypothetical Trade at Support

Scenario: Stock is falling toward a known support level at $100.

1. At what price would you buy? (Answer: $100 or slightly above)
2. Where would you place your stop loss? (Answer: below support)
3. Where would you place your profit target? (Answer: next resistance)
4. Why would you buy at support? (Answer: historically bounces up here)

### Exercise 3: Trading Range Strategy

Find a stock that's been bouncing between two prices for 2+ weeks.

1. Identify the support level
2. Identify the resistance level
3. Calculate profit per "bounce trade"
4. If you caught 5 bounces, how much would you profit?

### Exercise 4: Support Becomes Resistance

Find a stock that broke through a previous support level.

1. Where was the old support?
2. At what price did it break support?
3. Did the stock's fall stop at a new level?
4. Is the old support now acting as resistance?

### Exercise 5: Multi-Timeframe Support/Resistance

Pick your favorite stock. Find support and resistance on:

1. Daily chart: Identify one support and one resistance
2. 4-hour chart: Identify one support and one resistance
3. 1-hour chart: Identify one support and one resistance

Answer: Do these levels align across timeframes?
