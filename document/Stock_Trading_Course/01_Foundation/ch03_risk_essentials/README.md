Risk management separates traders who last decades from traders who blow up accounts. The difference between someone who makes money and someone who loses everything is not how many trades they win - it's how they manage the losses.

This chapter teaches you the foundational rules that 90% of beginners ignore and 100% of professionals follow religiously.

**Time to complete:** 4-5 hours (all lessons + exercises)

**Prerequisite:** Completion of Chapters 1 & 2 (Market Fundamentals & Trading Basics)

### Lesson 3.5: Risk-Reward Ratio Fundamentals
**Time: 25-30 minutes**

You don't need a high win rate if you have good risk-reward. Learn:

## The Core Rules You Must Memorize

### Rule 1: The 1-2% Risk Rule
**Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade.**

This is non-negotiable. This single rule separates professional traders from broke ones.

### Rule 2: Always Use Stop Losses
**Place a hard stop loss on EVERY trade before you enter.**

Stop losses must be:
- Based on technical support levels
- Set immediately after entry
- Never adjusted wider (only tighter once profitable)
- Executed automatically (not mentally)

### Rule 3: Position Size Formula
**Position Size = (Account × Risk %) ÷ Stop Loss Distance**

This is mechanical. No emotion. No overriding. The formula determines your position size.

### Rule 4: Risk-Reward Minimum
**Only take trades with 1:1.5 minimum risk-reward ratio.**

If you risk $100 to make $150, that's acceptable.
If you risk $100 to make $50, that's not.

### Rule 5: Diversify Appropriately
**Own 4-8 positions minimum (depending on account size).**

No single position should exceed 40-50% of your account.

---

## Real-World Examples: Different Account Sizes

### Example 1: $10,000 Account

**Position Sizing:**
- 1% risk per trade = $100
- Stop distance of $5 = 20 share position
- Stop distance of $10 = 10 share position

**Portfolio:**
- Can hold 3-5 positions simultaneously
- Each position: 10-25% of account
- Total portfolio risk: 3-5% per round of stops

**Example Trade:**
- Entry: Apple at $150
- Stop: $145 (support level)
- Target: $160
- Risk-Reward: 1:2 ✓
- Position: 20 shares = $3,000 (30% of account)
- Max loss if stopped: $100 (1% of account)

### Example 2: $20,000 Account

**Position Sizing:**
- 1% risk per trade = $200
- Stop distance of $5 = 40 share position
- Stop distance of $10 = 20 share position

**Portfolio:**
- Can hold 5-8 positions simultaneously
- Each position: 10-25% of account
- Total portfolio risk: 5-8% per round of stops

**Example Trade:**
- Entry: Microsoft at $300
- Stop: $290 (support level)
- Target: $320
- Risk-Reward: 1:2 ✓
- Position: 20 shares = $6,000 (30% of account)
- Max loss if stopped: $200 (1% of account)

### Example 3: $25,000 Account

**Position Sizing:**
- 1% risk per trade = $250
- Stop distance of $5 = 50 share position
- Stop distance of $10 = 25 share position

**Portfolio:**
- Can hold 5-10 positions simultaneously
- Each position: 10-25% of account
- Total portfolio risk: 5-10% per round of stops

**Example Trade:**
- Entry: Tesla at $250
- Stop: $240 (support level)
- Target: $275
- Risk-Reward: 1:2 ✓
- Position: 25 shares = $6,250 (25% of account)
- Max loss if stopped: $250 (1% of account)

## Common Misconceptions (AVOID THESE)

### Misconception 1: "1% Risk Limits My Returns"
**False.** With good risk-reward ratios, 1% risk allows 20%+ annual returns.
**Reality:** It's the ONLY way to achieve sustainable returns.

### Misconception 2: "I'm Too Good for Risk Management"
**False.** Professional traders with 20+ years of experience follow strict rules.
**Reality:** The better you get, the MORE disciplined you become.

### Misconception 3: "I'll Just Recover Losses Quickly"
**False.** A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover.
**Reality:** It's exponentially harder to recover from large losses than to avoid them.

### Misconception 4: "Diversification Reduces My Gains"
**False.** One concentrated position that loses 50% and one diversified portfolio that gains 20% annually - which wins over 10 years?
**Reality:** Diversification increases long-term returns by avoiding catastrophic losses.

### Misconception 5: "I Can Skip Stop Losses and Watch Manually"
**False.** Discipline evaporates when real money is involved.
**Reality:** Hard stop losses enforce discipline. Mental discipline fails.

## Critical Mindset Shift

### Before (Wrong Mindset):
"I want to make as much as possible per trade."
"Risk management is limiting."
"I don't need rules - I'll trade by feel."
"Losses are failures."

### After (Correct Mindset):
"I want the highest probability of long-term survival."
"Risk management creates sustainable returns."
"Rules are what separate professionals from amateurs."
"Losses are the cost of trading. Small losses are success."

This mindset shift is more important than any calculation.

## Chapter Summary

Risk management is not the exciting part of trading. It's the part that determines whether you:
- Trade for 30 years, OR
- Blow up your account in 30 days

The statistics are brutal:
- 90% of traders lose money within the first year
- Most losses occur from a single bad trade
- The difference between winners and losers is risk management, not stock picking

This chapter gives you the framework to be in the 10% who survive and thrive.

**One more time: The three rules that matter:**
1. **Never risk more than 1-2% per trade**
2. **Always use stop losses based on technical levels**
3. **Only take trades with good risk-reward ratios (minimum 1:1.5)**

Master these three rules, and you've already beaten 90% of traders.

## Questions or Need Help?

If any concept isn't clear:
1. Re-read that lesson
2. Work through the examples with different numbers
3. Practice the calculations until they're automatic
4. Don't move forward until it clicks

There's no shame in rereading a lesson 3-4 times. Risk management is complex enough that most traders need multiple exposures.
