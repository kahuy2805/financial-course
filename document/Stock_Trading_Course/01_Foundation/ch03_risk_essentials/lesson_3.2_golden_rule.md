### The Golden Rule Defined

**The Golden Rule of Trading:**

> **Never risk more than 1-2% of your total trading account on a single trade.**

**What does "risk" mean?**

Risk = The amount of money you will lose if the trade goes wrong and hits your stop loss.

**This is the most important distinction:** Risk is not the same as position size.

#### Example of Risk vs. Position Size

**Scenario A:**
- Account: $20,000
- Stock price: $100
- You want to buy 20 shares = $2,000 position
- Your stop loss: $95 (5 points down)
- Your risk: $100 if it hits your stop loss (20 shares × $5) = 0.5% of account

**This is acceptable risk.**

**Scenario B:**
- Account: $20,000
- Stock price: $100
- You want to buy 50 shares = $5,000 position
- Your stop loss: $80 (20 points down)
- Your risk: $1,000 if it hits your stop loss (50 shares × $20) = 5% of account

**This violates the Golden Rule** (too much risk).

### Why 1-2%? (The Math Behind the Rule)

The 1-2% rule is not arbitrary. It's based on the mathematics of losing streaks.

#### Expected Losing Streaks

Even professional traders with 60% win rates will have stretches where they lose multiple trades in a row.

**Realistic losing streaks:**
- 3-4 losing trades in a row: Very common
- 5-6 losing trades in a row: Happens regularly
- 7-10 losing trades in a row: Expect maybe 2-3 times per year
- 10+ losing trades in a row: Rare but possible

#### The Impact on Your Account

**With 1% risk per trade:**
- 10 consecutive losses = -10% account decline
- You lose $1,000 on a $10,000 account
- You can continue trading, learning, and recovering

**With 2% risk per trade:**
- 10 consecutive losses = -20% account decline
- You lose $2,000 on a $10,000 account
- Significant but still recoverable

**With 5% risk per trade:**
- 10 consecutive losses = -50% account decline
- You lose $5,000 on a $10,000 account
- Recovery now requires 100% gain (extremely difficult)

**With 10% risk per trade:**
- 10 consecutive losses = Your entire account is gone
- You need 10 consecutive wins to recover (while having nothing left to trade with)

**The Golden Rule ensures that even a bad losing streak leaves you with most of your capital intact.**

### The Professional Framework: Expected Value

Professional traders think in terms of expected value across many trades, not individual trade outcomes.

**The Formula:**

> **Expectancy = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)**

#### Example 1: Trader with 50% Win Rate

**Trade Details:**
- Win rate: 50%
- Average win: 3% of position
- Average loss: -1.5% (due to tight stop loss)
- Risk per trade: 1% of account

**Expected Value Per Trade:**
= (0.50 × 1%) - (0.50 × 1%)
= 0.5% - 0.5%
= **0% expectancy**

**This seems bad!** But it's actually neutral. Here's the important part: **with only 1% risk, you can take 100 of these trades and be fine.**

If you break even on expected value with 1% risk, your account doesn't grow much, but it survives. You can learn, adjust, and improve.

#### Example 2: Same Trader with Poor Risk Management

**Trade Details:**
- Win rate: 50%
- Average win: 3% of position
- Average loss: -1.5%
- Risk per trade: 10% of account (violates the rule)

**Expected Value Per Trade:**
= (0.50 × 10%) - (0.50 × 10%)
= 5% - 5%
= **0% expectancy**

**The math is the same.** But psychologically and practically:

- After just 10 trades, you're down 10-100% depending on sequence
- You're making emotional decisions
- You're revenge trading
- Your account is wiped before you can learn

**The outcome is the same long-term (+0% in both), but the journey is completely different.**

### Case Study: The Difference Between 1% and 5% Risk

Let's track two traders with identical skills over 100 trades.

**Assumptions:**
- Starting account: $10,000
- Win rate: 55% (realistic for a decent trader)
- Average win: 2% (on risk)
- Average loss: -2% (on risk)
- 100 trades

**Trader A: Following the Golden Rule (1% risk)**

Expected value per trade: (0.55 × 1%) - (0.45 × 1%) = 0.55% - 0.45% = **+0.1% per trade**

| Trade | Account | Wins | Loss Streak |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| 10 | $10,100 | 5 | - |
| 25 | $10,363 | 14 | 3 |
| 50 | $10,888 | 28 | 6 |
| 75 | $11,520 | 41 | 4 |
| 100 | $12,180 | 55 | 5 |

**Final Result:** Account grew from $10,000 to $12,180 (+21.8%)

**Status:** Still trading, still learning, healthy account

**Trader B: Ignoring the Rule (5% risk)**

Expected value per trade: (0.55 × 5%) - (0.45 × 5%) = 2.75% - 2.25% = **+0.5% per trade**

Same 55% win rate, but 5× the risk per trade.

| Trade | Account | Wins | Note |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| 10 | $10,000 | 6 | Started strong |
| 15 | $9,140 | 8 | Lost 3 in a row |
| 20 | $6,800 | 10 | Lost 4 in a row |
| 22 | $3,480 | 11 | Lost 6 in a row - panic setting in |
| 23 | $1,580 | 11 | Account at risk |
| 25 | $600 | 12 | Desperate revenge trading |
| 30 | $0 | 12 | **Account wiped** |

**Final Result:** Account destroyed after 30 trades (70 trades before completion)

**Status:** Trading stopped, lost money, unable to continue learning

**Both traders had the same skill level (55% win rate).** The only difference was risk management.

Trader A is now up $2,180 and learning. Trader B is wiped out and demoralized.

### Understanding "Risk"

This is the most commonly misunderstood concept in trading.

#### What Risk IS:

**Risk = The maximum amount you WILL lose if the trade goes wrong**

This is determined by:
1. Your position size (how many shares)
2. Your stop loss level (where you'll exit if wrong)
3. The difference between entry and stop loss

**Example:**
- Buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50
- Stop loss at $48
- Risk per share: $2
- Total risk: 100 × $2 = $200

If your account is $20,000, your risk is $200 ÷ $20,000 = **1% of account**

This is acceptable.

#### What Risk is NOT:

- It's NOT the position size ($5,000 in the above example)
- It's NOT how much money you invested
- It's NOT the total potential loss if the stock goes to zero (use stop losses)

**The critical insight:** You can have a large position and small risk (tight stop loss) or small position and large risk (wide stop loss).

### The Golden Rule in Different Market Conditions

**Important:** The 1-2% rule doesn't change based on market conditions.

#### Bull Market (Prices Rising)
- Beginners often think: "Risk more, market is friendly"
- Reality: Losing streaks still happen. Use 1-2% rule
- Compliance: SAME 1-2% risk

#### Bear Market (Prices Falling)
- Beginners often think: "Risk less, market is dangerous"
- Reality: This is correct instinct, but implement it by taking fewer trades, not risking more per trade
- Compliance: SAME 1-2% risk (but maybe 3 trades instead of 10)

#### Volatile Market (Big Swings)
- Beginners often think: "Risk less due to volatility"
- Reality: With higher volatility, stops need to be wider, so position sizes get smaller automatically
- Compliance: SAME 1-2% risk formula

**The point:** The rule is constant. Let the rule adjust your position size automatically.

### How to Calculate Position Size from Risk

This is the practical application of the Golden Rule.

**The Formula:**

```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) ÷ (Entry - Stop Loss)
```

#### Example 1: $20,000 Account

**Setup:**
- Account: $20,000
- Want to risk: 1% = $200
- Stock: Apple (AAPL)
- Entry price: $150
- Stop loss: $145
- Risk per share: $5

**Calculation:**
Position Size = ($20,000 × 0.01) ÷ $5
Position Size = $200 ÷ $5
Position Size = **40 shares**

**Verification:**
- 40 shares × $150 = $6,000 position
- If stops at $145: lose $200 = 1% of account ✓

#### Example 2: $15,000 Account with Different Stock

**Setup:**
- Account: $15,000
- Want to risk: 2% = $300
- Stock: Tesla (TSLA)
- Entry price: $180
- Stop loss: $170
- Risk per share: $10

**Calculation:**
Position Size = ($15,000 × 0.02) ÷ $10
Position Size = $300 ÷ $10
Position Size = **30 shares**

**Verification:**
- 30 shares × $180 = $5,400 position
- If stops at $170: lose $300 = 2% of account ✓

#### Example 3: Complex Scenario with Fractional Shares

**Setup:**
- Account: $10,000
- Want to risk: 1% = $100
- Stock: Amazon (AMZN)
- Entry price: $155
- Stop loss: $150
- Risk per share: $5

**Calculation:**
Position Size = ($10,000 × 0.01) ÷ $5
Position Size = $100 ÷ $5
Position Size = **20 shares**

Many brokers now allow fractional shares, so you can be precise with this calculation.

### The Golden Rule with Real Portfolio Examples

#### Small Account: $10,000

**1% Risk:**
- Risk per trade: $100
- Possible positions depending on stop loss width:
  - Tight stop ($2 range): 50 shares
  - Medium stop ($5 range): 20 shares
  - Wide stop ($10 range): 10 shares

**You can have 20-30 active positions** before hitting account diversification limits.

#### Medium Account: $20,000

**1% Risk:**
- Risk per trade: $200
- Possible positions depending on stop loss width:
  - Tight stop ($2 range): 100 shares
  - Medium stop ($5 range): 40 shares
  - Wide stop ($10 range): 20 shares

**You can have 10-15 active positions** for good diversification.

#### Larger Account: $50,000

**1% Risk:**
- Risk per trade: $500
- Possible positions depending on stop loss width:
  - Tight stop ($2 range): 250 shares
  - Medium stop ($5 range): 100 shares
  - Wide stop ($10 range): 50 shares

**You can have 5-10 active positions** while maintaining healthy concentration.

## Real-World Application

### Your First Real Trade Using the Golden Rule

**Your Situation:**
- Account: $15,000
- You've identified Apple (AAPL) at $150 as a good entry
- Current market condition: Slightly bullish
- Risk tolerance: 2% per trade (you're slightly aggressive but still safe)

**Step 1: Determine Stop Loss**

Where should you exit if wrong?
- Technical support at $145 (5 points below entry)
- That feels like a reasonable stop loss

**Step 2: Calculate Risk**

Risk = (Entry - Stop) × Shares
But we need to work backwards from our 2% account risk.

Risk amount = $15,000 × 0.02 = $300 per trade

**Step 3: Calculate Position Size**

Position Size = Risk ÷ (Entry - Stop)
Position Size = $300 ÷ ($150 - $145)
Position Size = $300 ÷ $5
Position Size = **60 shares**

**Step 4: Verify**

60 shares × $150 = $9,000 position size (60% of account - reasonable)
If it hits stop at $145: 60 × $5 = $300 loss = 2% of account ✓

**Step 5: Place Trade**

Enter: Buy 60 shares of AAPL at $150
Stop Loss: Set at $145
Target: You can set a profit target (covered in future lessons)

**The key point:** Every decision follows mathematically from the 1-2% rule.

### Common Objection: "But That's Such Small Positions!"

**The Question:**
"If I only risk 1-2% per trade, how will I ever get rich?"

**The Answer:**

With proper position sizing and good trading, here's realistic growth:

**Scenario: $20,000 Account, 1% Risk, 55% Win Rate**

| Month | Trades | Wins | Losses | Account | Monthly Return |
|-------|--------|------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | 20 | 11 | 9 | $20,400 | +2% |
| 2 | 22 | 12 | 10 | $20,850 | +2.2% |
| 3 | 25 | 14 | 11 | $21,400 | +2.6% |
| 4 | 20 | 11 | 9 | $21,800 | +1.9% |
| 5 | 23 | 12 | 11 | $22,350 | +2.5% |
| 6 | 25 | 14 | 11 | $22,900 | +2.5% |

**After 6 months: $20,000 → $22,900 (+14.5%)**

If you're making consistent 2% monthly returns with proper risk management, you're beating 95% of traders and most mutual fund managers.

Over years, compound growth turns this into substantial wealth.

The traders who "get rich quick" with 10% or 20% per trade either:
1. Get lucky (and then lose it all)
2. Are actually skilled and manage to survive despite poor risk management
3. Never existed (selection bias)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Confusing Risk Percentage with Win Percentage
**Reality:** 1% risk per trade doesn't mean you have a 1% chance of winning. It means you lose maximum 1% if the trade goes wrong. This is different from win rate.

### Mistake #2: Using Different Risk Percentages for Different Stocks
**Reality:** Risk the same percentage for every trade. Don't risk 1% on a boring stock and 5% on an exciting one. Consistency is key.

### Mistake #3: Forgetting to Include Commission/Slippage
**Reality:** When calculating risk, account for trading costs. Your actual loss might be 1.1-1.3% due to commissions.

### Mistake #4: Violating the Rule "Just This Once"
**Reality:** This once becomes twice becomes a habit. Every single trade follows the rule, or you abandon it entirely.

### Mistake #5: Thinking You're So Good You Don't Need the Rule
**Reality:** Professional traders follow strict risk management. The better you get, the MORE disciplined you become with rules, not less.

## Quick Review

**The Golden Rule:**
- Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade

**Why It Works:**
- Even with a 55% win rate, 10 consecutive losses are possible
- 1% risk means 10 losses = 10% account decline (survivable)
- 10% risk means 10 losses = account destroyed (game over)

**How to Use It:**
1. Determine your stop loss (where you'll exit if wrong)
2. Calculate risk = (Entry - Stop) × Shares
3. Work backwards: Position Size = Risk $ ÷ (Entry - Stop)
4. Place trade with strict stop loss

**The Outcome:**
- Your account compounds slowly but surely
- You survive losing streaks
- You learn from experience
- You're in the game long-term

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Risk Calculation Drills

For each scenario, calculate the proper position size using the Golden Rule (1% risk).

**Setup 1: $15,000 Account**
- Stock: Microsoft (MSFT) at $300
- Stop loss: $295
- Risk amount (1%): $_______
- Position size: _______ shares
- Total position value: $_______

**Setup 2: $25,000 Account**
- Stock: Google (GOOGL) at $140
- Stop loss: $135
- Risk amount (1%): $_______
- Position size: _______ shares
- Total position value: $_______

**Setup 3: $10,000 Account**
- Stock: Netflix (NFLX) at $250
- Stop loss: $240
- Risk amount (1%): $_______
- Position size: _______ shares
- Total position value: $_______

### Exercise 2: The Impact of Different Risk Levels

Starting with $20,000, calculate your account value after 10 consecutive losses:

**At 1% risk:**
- Loss per trade: $_______
- Total loss: $_______
- Account after: $_______

**At 2% risk:**
- Loss per trade: $_______
- Total loss: $_______
- Account after: $_______

**At 5% risk:**
- Loss per trade: $_______
- Total loss: $_______
- Account after: $_______

**At 10% risk:**
- Loss per trade: $_______
- Total loss: $_______
- Account after: $_______

What pattern do you notice?

### Exercise 3: Real Trade Planning

Plan your first 5 trades using the Golden Rule:

For each trade, write:
1. Stock name and entry price
2. Stop loss level (and your reasoning)
3. Risk amount (1% of your account)
4. Calculated position size
5. Total position value
6. What percentage of your account this represents
