## Core Content

### What is a Security?

**Security**: Any financial instrument that can be bought and sold and represents value.

Think of it like:
- **Currency**: Paper money is a "security" - it's tradeable and represents value
- **Concert tickets**: Can be bought/sold/resold for money
- **Real estate**: A house is a security - you can buy and sell it
- **Art**: Paintings are securities - they're traded between collectors

In the financial context, securities are investments tradeable in markets.

### The Three Main Categories

Securities fall into three main buckets:

1. **Equity Securities** - Ownership in a company (stocks)
2. **Debt Securities** - Loans you give to companies or governments (bonds)
3. **Derivative Securities** - Contracts based on other securities (options)

Let's explore each:

---

## 1. EQUITY SECURITIES (Ownership)

You've already learned about stocks, which are equity securities. Let's expand:

### Common Stocks

**What They Are:**
Pieces of ownership in a company that give you:
- Voting rights (in shareholder meetings)
- Rights to dividends (if the company distributes profits)
- Rights to residual value (if company is liquidated)

**Real Example:**
You own 100 shares of Apple out of 15 billion total shares. You own 100/15,000,000,000 = 0.0000007% of Apple. Tiny, but real ownership.

**Characteristics:**
- No guaranteed return
- Can gain or lose value
- Dividends vary by company and year
- Higher growth potential than bonds
- Higher risk than bonds

### Preferred Stocks

**What They Are:**
A hybrid between stocks and bonds. They have characteristics of both.

**How They Differ from Common Stock:**
- Higher dividend payments (more predictable)
- Dividend paid before common stockholders get paid
- Don't usually have voting rights
- Less growth potential
- Lower risk than common stocks

**Real Example:**
A company might issue preferred stock paying 5% dividend yearly. It's almost like a bond but with a fixed value.

**Who Buys Them:**
- Conservative investors seeking income
- Retirement portfolios
- Banks and insurance companies

### Comparison: Common vs Preferred Stock

| Aspect | Common Stock | Preferred Stock |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ownership | Yes | Yes (non-voting usually) |
| Dividends | Variable | Fixed |
| Growth | Higher potential | Lower potential |
| Risk | Higher | Lower |
| When paid | Last | First |

---

## 2. DEBT SECURITIES (Bonds)

### What is a Bond?

Imagine your friend needs $1,000. Instead of giving it as a gift, you offer a deal:
- "I'll lend you $1,000"
- "You'll pay me $50 interest per year ($1,000 × 5%)"
- "In 10 years, you'll return my $1,000"

**You've created a bond.**

**Bond Definition**: A loan issued by a company or government. When you buy a bond, you're the lender.

### How Bonds Work

**Bond Components:**

**Face Value (Par Value):** The amount you'll get back
- Usually $1,000 per bond
- Example: You buy a bond with $1,000 face value

**Coupon Rate:** The interest rate you'll receive
- Fixed at issue
- Example: 5% coupon rate

**Maturity Date:** When you get your money back
- Example: 10 years from issue

**The Payment:**
- You pay $1,000 today
- Receive $50 per year ($1,000 × 5%) for 10 years
- Get $1,000 back in 10 years
- Total received: $1,500 ($50 × 10 years + $1,000 principal)

### Types of Bonds

#### Government Bonds

**U.S. Treasury Bonds:**
- Issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury
- Backed by U.S. government
- Extremely safe (lowest risk)
- Lower interest rates (2-5%)

**Real Example:**
A 10-year Treasury bond pays 4% interest yearly. Very safe, but lower returns than stocks.

#### Corporate Bonds

**What They Are:**
- Issued by companies
- Backed by the company's ability to pay
- Higher interest rates (5-10%+)
- Higher risk than government bonds

**Real Example:**
Apple issues a 5-year bond paying 6% interest. Apple must pay, or it would face financial ruin and lawsuits.

#### Municipal Bonds

**What They Are:**
- Issued by states and cities
- Usually for infrastructure projects
- Tax advantages (interest isn't taxed federally)
- Lower interest rates (3-5%)

**Real Example:**
New York City issues a bond to fund a new subway line. Investors who are NYC residents get tax advantages.

### Key Bond Characteristics

**Predictable Income:**
Bonds provide regular, known payments. If you need reliable income, bonds are attractive.

**Less Volatile:**
Bond prices change less dramatically than stocks. Good for risk-averse investors.

**Fixed Time Horizon:**
You know when you'll get paid back (maturity date).

**Inverse Price/Interest Rate Relationship:**
If you own a 5% bond and new bonds are issued paying 6%, your bond's market price drops (because it's less attractive). If you hold to maturity, this doesn't matter. If you sell early, it does.

### Bonds vs Stocks: Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Stocks | Bonds |
|--------|--------|-------|
| What you own | Company ownership | Company debt |
| Returns | Variable (growth + dividends) | Fixed (interest payments) |
| Predictability | Low | High |
| Risk | Higher | Lower |
| Growth potential | Higher | Lower |
| Income | Dividends (if any) | Interest (guaranteed) |
| Voting rights | Yes | No |

## 3. COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SECURITIES

These are securities that bundle other investments together:

### Mutual Funds

**What They Are:**
A fund that pools money from many investors and buys a portfolio of stocks/bonds.

**How They Work:**
1. You give $1,000 to the mutual fund
2. The fund combines it with money from thousands of other investors
3. Professional managers buy stocks/bonds on behalf of all investors
4. You own shares of the mutual fund (not directly own the stocks)
5. Your returns = how well the fund's investments perform

**Advantages:**
- Professional management
- Diversification (spreads risk across many investments)
- Access to investments you couldn't afford alone
- Easy to buy/sell

**Disadvantages:**
- Management fees (1-2% annually)
- Less control (you don't pick the stocks)
- Potential for over-diversification (can limit gains)

**Real Example:**
Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund pools money from 20 million investors and buys all 500 companies in the S&P 500. Your small investment gets you exposure to 500 companies.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

**What They Are:**
Like mutual funds but traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks.

**Key Differences from Mutual Funds:**
- Trade throughout the day (like stocks)
- Lower fees (often 0.03-0.30%)
- More tax-efficient
- Greater variety available

**Real Example:**
SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. You can buy SPY like you buy Apple stock, but you're actually buying exposure to 500 companies.

**Why ETFs Became Popular:**
- Lower fees than mutual funds
- Better for trading/rebalancing
- Newer technology

### Index Funds

**What They Are:**
Funds designed to track a market index.

**How They Work:**
An index (like the S&P 500) is a basket of companies. The fund buys the exact companies in that basket in the same proportions.

**Real Example:**
S&P 500 Index Fund owns the same 500 companies as the S&P 500, in the same weights. If Apple is 7% of the index, the fund holds 7% Apple.

**Advantages:**
- Extremely low fees
- Transparent (you know exactly what you own)
- Historically outperform most active funds
- Simple strategy

**Disadvantages:**
- You get "average" returns, not better than average
- Less exciting than picking individual stocks
- Can't do better than the index (by definition)

**The Warren Buffett Recommendation:**
Warren Buffett suggests most people buy S&P 500 index funds. Even he directs his estate to do this. If the greatest investor of all time recommends index funds, they're worth understanding.

### Comparison: Mutual Funds vs ETFs vs Individual Stocks

| Aspect | Individual Stocks | Mutual Funds | ETFs | Index Funds |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------|------------|
| Diversification | No (if you own 1) | High | High | Very High |
| Trading frequency | Daily | Usually daily | All day | Usually daily |
| Fees | Minimal | 1-2% | 0.03-0.5% | 0.03-0.25% |
| Control | High | Low | Low | None |
| Complexity | Medium | Low | Medium | Low |
| Time required | High | Low | Low | Very Low |

## 4. DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (Advanced)

### What are Derivatives?

**Derivative**: A security whose value is derived from another security.

Think of it like:
- A bet on a sports game (value depends on the game outcome)
- A future contract for wheat (value depends on wheat prices)
- An option on Apple stock (value depends on Apple stock price)

**Key Point:** Derivatives are bets on what other securities will do, not direct ownership.

### Options (Simplified)

**Call Option:**
"The right to buy 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date"

**Real Example:**
- Current Apple price: $150
- You buy a call option: "Right to buy at $145 in 30 days"
- If Apple rises to $160, you exercise: Buy at $145, worth $160 = $15/share profit
- If Apple falls to $140, you don't exercise: You just lose the cost of the option

**Put Option:**
"The right to sell 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date"

**Real Example:**
- Current Apple price: $150
- You buy a put option: "Right to sell at $155 in 30 days"
- If Apple falls to $130, you exercise: Sell at $155, worth $130 = $25/share profit
- If Apple rises to $160, you don't exercise: You just lose the cost of the option

### Why Options Exist

**For Hedging (Protection):**
You own Apple stock. You buy a put option to protect against sharp drops.

**For Speculation:**
You think Apple will rise. Buying calls with leverage amplifies your gains (and losses).

**For Income:**
You own stock. You sell calls to earn premium income.

### Options Characteristics

**Leverage:**
Options cost less than stocks but move more dramatically in price.

**Time Decay:**
Options lose value as their expiration date approaches.

**High Risk/Reward:**
You can lose 100% of your option investment or gain 500%+.

**Complexity:**
Requires more knowledge than stocks.

**Not Recommended for Beginners:**
Understand stocks and bonds thoroughly before touching options.

## 5. OTHER SECURITIES

### Funds of Funds

Funds that invest in other funds. Usually have higher fees and less transparency. Generally avoid these.

### Commodities

Tradeable goods like:
- Oil
- Gold
- Wheat
- Copper

Usually traded through futures contracts or ETFs, not directly.

### Cryptocurrencies

Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Highly volatile, emerging asset class.

### REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

Companies that own real estate. They must distribute 90% of profits as dividends. Good for real estate exposure without owning physical property.

**Real Example:**
You can own a piece of a company that owns office buildings across the country without actually owning a building yourself.

---

## Security Selection Framework

**For Beginners:**
- Start with stocks of well-known companies
- Progress to mutual funds or ETFs for diversification
- Learn bonds for portfolio stability
- Leave options and derivatives until you're experienced

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Conservative: Bonds (60%), Index Funds (40%)
- Moderate: Stocks (50%), Bonds (50%)
- Aggressive: Stocks (80%), Bonds (20%)

**Time Horizon:**
- Short-term (< 3 years): Bonds, Money Market
- Medium-term (3-10 years): Mixed (stocks + bonds)
- Long-term (> 10 years): Mostly stocks

---

## Real-World Application

### Building a Diversified Portfolio

Imagine you have $10,000 to invest as a beginner:

**Conservative Approach:**
- $4,000 in a bond fund (safe, stable)
- $6,000 in an S&P 500 index fund (growth)
- Result: Steady income + long-term growth

**Moderate Approach:**
- $2,000 in individual stocks you research (Apple, Nike, etc.)
- $3,000 in a dividend ETF (income)
- $5,000 in a growth ETF (growth)
- Result: Mix of learning, income, and growth

**Aggressive Approach:**
- $7,000 in individual growth stocks
- $3,000 in a growth-focused ETF
- Result: Higher growth potential but higher risk

### Understanding Prospectus and Costs

Every security comes with a "prospectus" - a detailed document explaining:
- What the investment does
- Fees and expenses
- Risk factors
- Historical performance

Always check the expense ratio (total fees as % of investment). 0.10% is great. 2%+ is expensive.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Thinking More Securities = Better Diversification
**Reality**: Owning 50 stocks is not necessarily more diversified than 10 if they're similar companies. An index fund diversifies automatically.

### Mistake #2: Believing All Bonds Are Safe
**Reality**: Government bonds are safe. Corporate bonds from struggling companies are risky. Check credit ratings.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Fees
**Reality**: A 2% fee might not sound big, but over 30 years it cuts your returns by 40%. Always check expense ratios.

### Mistake #4: Buying Options Without Understanding Them
**Reality**: Options can amplify losses. Don't trade them until you fully understand the mechanics and have capital you can afford to lose.

### Mistake #5: Assuming Past Performance Predicts Future Results
**Reality**: Even funds that beat the market one year often underperform the next. Consistency matters more than spectacular single years.
