## Overview

Once you've chosen your broker, you need to decide what type of account to open. Different accounts have different rules about what you can do, how they're taxed, and what profits you can earn. In this lesson, you'll learn the main account types and which is right for your situation.

**Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 2.1 (chosen your broker)
- Understand basic investment concepts
- Basic tax awareness (doesn't need to be detailed)

---

## Core Content

### The Main Account Types

Think of account types like different containers for your investments:
- Some containers are optimized for long-term saving (tax benefits)
- Some containers are flexible but taxed more heavily
- Some containers let you borrow money to invest
- Some containers are just for getting started

There's no "best" account - it depends on your goals and situation.

### 1. Cash Account (Brokerage Account)

**Also called:** Taxable brokerage account, individual brokerage account

**The Basics:**
- The simplest account type
- You deposit your own money (no employer involvement)
- You pay taxes on profits and dividends every year
- You own whatever you buy - no borrowing

**How It Works:**

Imagine you have $5,000 in cash. You:
1. Open a cash account at Fidelity
2. Deposit your $5,000
3. Buy $2,000 of Apple stock and $3,000 of Microsoft
4. If Apple goes up $500, you made a $500 profit
5. At tax time, you report that $500 gain (and pay taxes on it)

**Advantages:**
- Unlimited contributions (put in as much as you want)
- Trade as frequently as you want
- No contribution deadline (can deposit any time)
- Full control of your money
- Simple to understand

**Disadvantages:**
- Profits are taxed as capital gains (15%-20% for long-term, up to 37% short-term)
- Dividends are taxed annually
- No tax breaks or deductions
- High trading can mean high tax bills

**Best For:**
- Money you already have that you want to invest
- Flexibility-focused investors
- Short-term traders (though long-term is still fine)
- Everyone can open one (no income limits, no age limits)

**Example:**
You're 25 with $2,000 from your summer job. Open a cash account, invest the $2,000, and let it grow. This is the most straightforward entry point.

### 2. Individual Retirement Account (IRA)

**The Basics:**
- Special account designed to help you save for retirement
- Tax-advantaged (either tax-free growth or tax-deductible contributions)
- Has contribution limits ($6,500/year in 2024)
- Penalties if you withdraw before age 59.5
- Two main types: Traditional and Roth

**Traditional IRA**

**How It Works:**
You contribute money before taxes are withheld. The government will tax you later when you withdraw in retirement.

**Example:**
- You earn $50,000
- You contribute $6,500 to Traditional IRA
- Your taxable income is only $43,500
- You pay less income tax this year
- That $6,500 grows tax-free
- In retirement, you pay taxes on withdrawals

**Advantages:**
- Reduce your current income taxes
- Tax-free growth for decades
- Money can grow a lot before you pay taxes

**Disadvantages:**
- Can't access money before 59.5 without penalties ($10,000+ penalties)
- Must withdraw starting at 73 (Required Minimum Distribution)
- Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income
- Contribution limited to $6,500/year

**Roth IRA**

**How It Works:**
You contribute money after taxes. Your money grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free too.

**Example:**
- You earn $50,000
- You contribute $6,500 to Roth IRA (after-tax money)
- You still pay income tax on the $50,000
- But that $6,500 and ALL its growth is tax-free forever
- In retirement, withdrawals are 100% tax-free

**Advantages:**
- Withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free
- Can withdraw your contributions anytime without penalty
- No Required Minimum Distribution (you can leave it forever)
- If you think taxes will rise, this is smart
- Small income limits don't apply if you use backdoor strategy

**Disadvantages:**
- Contribution is NOT tax-deductible (you pay full income tax)
- Cannot withdraw earnings before 59.5 without penalty
- Limited to $6,500/year contribution
- High earners have phase-out limits

**Traditional vs Roth (Quick Comparison):**

| Feature | Traditional | Roth |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Contribution Tax | Deductible | Not deductible |
| Growth Tax | Tax-deferred | Tax-free |
| Withdrawal Tax | Taxed | Tax-free |
| Best If | Want to reduce current taxes | Want tax-free retirement |
| Age to Withdraw | 59.5+ | 59.5+ (contributions anytime) |

**Best For:**
- Long-term retirement saving (20+ years away)
- Anyone with earned income
- Tax optimization
- Building wealth slowly and steadily

**Real Example:**
You're 25 earning $45,000/year. Open a Roth IRA and contribute $6,500. By age 65, assuming 7% annual growth, that $6,500 could grow to $200,000+ completely tax-free.

### 3. 401(k) - Employer Retirement Plan

**The Basics:**
- Offered by many employers
- You contribute via payroll deductions
- Employer often matches your contributions (free money!)
- Much higher contribution limits ($23,500 in 2024)
- Penalties for withdrawing early

**How It Works:**

Your paycheck is $3,000. You elect to contribute 10% to your 401(k):
1. You contribute $300 (pre-tax)
2. Your employer adds $300 match (free money!)
3. You receive $2,400 take-home pay
4. Your $600 total grows tax-deferred
5. At retirement, you withdraw (and pay taxes)

**Advantages:**
- Employer matching is free money
- High contribution limits ($23,500/year)
- Automatic contributions from paycheck
- Tax-deferred growth
- Reduced current income taxes

**Disadvantages:**
- Can't access money before 59.5 without penalties
- Limited investment choices (employer decides)
- Mandatory withdrawals starting at 73
- Employer holds the account
- Less flexibility than IRAs

**Best For:**
- Anyone with an employer offering a 401(k)
- Maximizing employer match (always do this!)
- People who want automatic investing

**Critical Insight:** If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money and an instant return on investment. Not doing so is leaving money on the table.

### 4. HSA - Health Savings Account

**The Basics:**
- Not technically for investing, but acts like an IRA
- Only available if you have a high-deductible health plan
- Can invest HSA money for long-term growth
- Triple tax advantage (rare and valuable!)
- Can be passed to heirs

**The Triple Tax Advantage:**
1. Contributions are tax-deductible
2. Growth is tax-free
3. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free
4. Bonus: No age requirement for medical withdrawals

**Example:**
You contribute $4,000 to your HSA for medical expenses. You don't spend it. Twenty years later it grows to $50,000. You pay for medical expenses from it - all tax-free.

**Best For:**
- Anyone with a high-deductible health plan
- Using as a secret retirement account (super powerful long-term)
- Reducing taxes while saving for healthcare

**Note:** HSAs are complex and powerful. Research carefully if eligible.

### 5. Margin Account

**The Basics:**
- Lets you borrow money from your broker to buy stocks
- Similar to getting a loan
- Can amplify profits AND losses
- Requires significant minimum ($2,000+ usually)

**How It Works:**

You have $5,000. Normally you can buy $5,000 of stocks. With a margin account, your broker lets you borrow $5,000, so you can buy $10,000 of stocks.

If the stocks go up 20%: You make $2,000 profit (40% return on your $5,000)
If the stocks go down 20%: You lose $2,000 (40% loss) PLUS interest on borrowed money

**Advantages:**
- Buy more stocks with less money (leverage)
- Can amplify profits

**Disadvantages:**
- Can amplify losses equally
- Margin calls (broker forces you to sell if account drops)
- Interest charged on borrowed money
- Complex and risky
- Can lose more than you invest

**Best For:**
- Experienced traders only
- NOT recommended for beginners

**Critical Warning:** Margin accounts are dangerous. Many beginners blow up their accounts using margin. Stick with cash accounts until you have significant experience.

### 6. Paper Trading / Simulator Account

**The Basics:**
- Not a real account with real money
- Simulates trading with fake money
- Let's you practice without risk

**Best For:**
- Complete beginners
- Testing strategies before real money
- Learning the platform

### Account Type Decision Matrix

**I'm a complete beginner:**
→ Start with a **Cash Account (Taxable Brokerage)**
- Simple, no restrictions, no taxes to worry about yet
- Once comfortable, consider Roth IRA

**I have earned income and want to save for retirement:**
→ Open a **Roth IRA** (or Traditional IRA)
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals beats everything long-term
- If employer has 401(k) with match: Contribute to 401(k) first to get match, then max Roth IRA

**My employer offers a 401(k):**
→ **Contribute to get the full match** (this is free money)
- Then consider Roth IRA
- Use cash account for additional investing

**I want maximum tax advantages:**
→ Use this order of priority:
1. Max out 401(k) employer match
2. Max out Roth IRA ($6,500)
3. If HSA-eligible, consider funding it
4. Use cash account for remaining funds

**I want to trade frequently or short-term:**
→ Use **Cash Account**
- Avoid IRA (restrictions on frequent trading violate spirit of account)
- Avoid margin (too risky for learning)

**I'm advanced and want to amplify returns:**
→ **Margin Account** (but understand risks)
- NOT recommended without significant experience
- Never use full leverage
- Have exit strategy for margin calls

## Real-World Application

### Sarah's Situation

Sarah is 28 years old, earns $55,000/year, and has $3,000 saved.

Her employer offers a 401(k) with 50% match up to 6% of salary.

**Sarah's Account Strategy:**
1. **401(k)** - Contribute 6% ($3,300/year) to get full employer match = $1,650 free money/year
2. **Roth IRA** - Contribute $6,500 (she can save for this)
3. **Cash Account** - Invest any additional money here

**Result:** Sarah is maximizing tax advantages and employer benefits while keeping flexibility.

### Marcus's Situation

Marcus is 22, just graduated, has $500 to invest, no employer 401(k) (works freelance).

**Marcus's Account Strategy:**
1. **Roth IRA** - Open one, contribute what he can (even small amounts help at 22)
2. **Cash Account** - Use this for any additional investing

**Why?** At 22, tax-free growth for 43 years is more valuable than anything else.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Ignoring Employer 401(k) Match
**Reality:** If your employer matches, you're turning down free money. Always contribute enough to get the full match.

### Mistake #2: Choosing Traditional IRA Over Roth (When Young)
**Reality:** Young people with low income should almost always choose Roth. 40+ years of tax-free growth beats tax deduction today.

### Mistake #3: Opening a Margin Account Too Soon
**Reality:** Margin amplifies losses. Beginners should master regular investing before touching margin.

### Mistake #4: Only Using Cash Account
**Reality:** If you have earned income, you're missing out on tax advantages. At minimum, open a Roth IRA.

### Mistake #5: Withdrawing from Retirement Accounts Early
**Reality:** That 10% penalty plus income taxes means you lose 25-40% of money you withdraw early. Let retirement money stay for retirement.

### Mistake #6: Not Knowing Your Roth IRA Contribution Limit
**Reality:** If you earn $200,000+, you can't contribute to Roth directly (but can use backdoor strategy). Know your limits.

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Self-Assessment
Answer these questions:
1. Do you have earned income? (YES/NO)
2. Does your employer offer a 401(k)? (YES/NO)
3. What's your age?
4. How much money do you want to invest this year?
5. When do you think you'll need this money?

### Exercise 2: Determine Your Account
Based on Exercise 1, write down:
1. What account type you should open first
2. How much you should contribute
3. What other accounts might be good later
4. Explain why you chose each one

### Exercise 3: Research Your Employer (If Applicable)
If your employer offers a 401(k):
1. What is the employer match percentage?
2. What is the vesting schedule?
3. How much are you currently contributing?
4. If not getting full match, what percentage should you contribute to get it?
5. What are the investment options?

### Exercise 4: Contribution Calculator
Use a compound interest calculator (search "retirement calculator") and calculate:
- If you contribute $6,500/year to Roth IRA from age 25-65
- Assuming 7% annual returns
- How much will it be worth at retirement?

(You'll likely find $1 million+ which shows the power of time and tax-free growth)
