## Core Content

### Before You Place Your First Trade

**Pre-Flight Checklist:**

1. **Do you have money in the account?**
   - Check your account cash balance
   - Most brokers show this prominently
   - You need enough cash for the purchase

2. **Have you researched the company?**
   - Read about the business (not just price)
   - Understand why you're buying
   - Know the risks
   - Don't buy just because price seems low

3. **Do you know how many shares to buy?**
   - Don't put all money in one stock
   - Diversify across at least 3-5 stocks if possible
   - Good rule: Don't let one position be more than 10% of portfolio
   - Start small (maybe 5-10 shares) if nervous

4. **Is your account fully funded?**
   - Did your deposit clear?
   - Check your broker's account status
   - Different brokers have different clearing times (1-3 business days for transfers)

5. **What's your goal?**
   - Are you buying to hold long-term (5+ years)?
   - Are you testing/learning?
   - Is this part of a larger strategy?
   - Know your timeline

### The Anatomy of a Trade

Before we walk through steps, understand what happens:

**You:** Click "Buy 10 shares of Apple at market price"
**Your Broker:** Takes your order
**Your Broker's System:** Routes to NYSE/NASDAQ exchange
**The Exchange:** Matches your buyer order with someone's seller order
**Result:** Confirmation - you own 10 shares, they own your cash

This entire process takes seconds.

### Step-by-Step: Placing Your First Trade

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Trading Screen

On your broker's platform (website or app):
- Look for "Trade" or "Buy" button
- Some brokers have "Order Entry" or "Trading Dashboard"
- Mobile apps usually have a "+" or "Buy" icon
- You should be logged into your account

**What you'll see:**
- A search box or field asking for ticker symbol
- Price information
- Fields for number of shares
- Order type options (we'll focus on "Market" order for first trade)

#### Step 2: Enter the Ticker Symbol

Type the company's ticker symbol. Use exactly correct spelling:
- AAPL (not APPLE or AAPPL)
- MSFT (not MICROSOFT or MICRO)
- GOOGL (not GOOGLE or GOOG)

**Pro Tip:** The platform will usually autocomplete or show suggestions. Use these to verify you have the right company.

**Verification Step:**
- System shows company name: "Apple Inc."
- Confirms you're trading the right ticker
- Shows current bid/ask prices

**Common Beginner Mistake:**
Some stocks have similar tickers:
- GOOG = Google Class C (most common)
- GOOGL = Google Class A (different voting rights, same company)
- Verify you want the right one

#### Step 3: Choose Order Type

For your FIRST trade, choose **"Market Order"** (most straightforward).

Order type options you'll see:
- Market (we'll use this for first trade)
- Limit (we'll cover in next lesson)
- Stop (we'll cover in next lesson)
- Other advanced types

**Market Order Simply Means:**
"Buy this stock at whatever the current market price is, immediately."

Advantages: Guaranteed to fill (you'll definitely get the stock)
Disadvantage: Exact price unknown until trade executes

We'll cover alternatives next lesson. For now, choose Market.

#### Step 4: Enter Quantity

Enter the number of shares you want to buy.

**Examples:**
- Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $100? Buy 10 shares
- Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $200? Buy 5 shares
- Want to invest $1,000 and stock is at $50? Buy 20 shares

**Quantity Math:**
Number of shares = Money to invest ÷ Stock price

**Input Field:**
- Type the number (e.g., 10)
- Some brokers show running total cost (nice feature)
- Others show: "10 shares × $195.48 = $1,954.80"

**Fractional Shares (Newer Feature):**
Many brokers now support fractional shares:
- You can buy $100 worth even if stock costs $195
- System automatically buys 0.512 shares
- Very useful for expensive stocks
- Gives you flexibility

**Quantity Decision:**
For your FIRST trade, consider:
- Start with a small amount (doesn't need to be much)
- Maybe 5-10 shares or $100-500 investment
- Learning is more important than profits
- Once confident, you can add more

#### Step 5: Review the Order Summary

Before submitting, the platform shows:

```
ORDER SUMMARY
─────────────────────
Stock: Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Order Type: Market
Quantity: 10 shares
Current Price: $195.48
Estimated Total: $1,954.80
Cash Available: $2,500.00
Cash After Trade: $545.20
```

**Check These Critical Points:**
- [ ] Right ticker? (AAPL)
- [ ] Right quantity? (10 shares)
- [ ] Right order type? (Market)
- [ ] Do you have enough cash? ($1,954.80 available? Yes)
- [ ] Is the estimated cost acceptable to you?

**Red Flag Moments:**
- If estimated cost is more than you expected (multiply shares × price to verify)
- If you don't have enough cash
- If you ordered wrong number of shares
- If ticker is wrong company
- Stop and fix it!

#### Step 6: Confirm and Submit

Look for "Submit Order," "Buy," "Confirm," or "Place Order" button.

Click it.

You'll likely get a warning: "Confirm: You are about to buy 10 shares of Apple for approximately $1,954.80. Your order will be submitted to the market immediately. Continue?"

**This is the safety confirmation.** It exists so you don't accidentally place a huge order.

**Click "Confirm" only if:**
- You've verified all details above
- You're ready to own this stock
- You're comfortable with the investment
- You understand you can't cancel immediately once submitted

(Actually, you can cancel in the next minute or so, but not after order fills.)

#### Step 7: Get Your Confirmation

Within seconds, you'll see:

```
ORDER CONFIRMED ✓
─────────────────────
Order Number: 12345678
Status: FILLED
Execution Time: 2:47 PM ET

Details:
Ticker: AAPL
Quantity: 10 shares
Price: $195.53 (actual execution price)
Total: $1,955.30
Commission: $0.00
```

**What "Filled" Means:**
- Your order executed successfully
- You now own 10 shares of Apple
- The cash was deducted from your account
- The shares were added to your holdings

**Price Might Be Slightly Different:**
- You saw bid/ask of $195.47 - $195.48
- Filled at $195.53
- The milliseconds between order and execution, prices might change
- This is normal (usually just cents difference)
- This is one reason to use limit orders (next lesson)

### After Your First Trade

#### What Happens Next?

**Immediately (within seconds):**
- Order shows in "My Orders" or "Order History"
- Your cash balance decreases by purchase amount
- Your holdings now show "10 shares AAPL"

**Within seconds/minutes:**
- The trade settles (officially completes)
- Your broker confirms you own the shares
- Most US stock trades settle "T+2" (2 business days) officially
- But you own them immediately in your account

**Your Account View:**

You'll see something like:

```
MY HOLDINGS
──────────────────────
Ticker  | Shares | Price | Value
────────┼────────┼───────┼──────────
AAPL    | 10     | $195.53 | $1,955.30

ACCOUNT SUMMARY
──────────────────────
Total Cash: $544.70
Total Holdings: $1,955.30
Account Value: $2,499.70
```

#### Watching Your Trade

**Good News:** You don't need to do anything now.

**Bad News:** You might be tempted to watch the price constantly.

**Reality:** The stock will go up and down. This is normal.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't panic if it drops 2% in an hour
- Don't immediately sell at a loss because you're nervous
- Don't obsess over intraday price movements
- Don't rush to add more or cut losses

**What TO do:**
- Let it sit for a few days/weeks
- Keep monitoring business news
- If something fundamentally changed, reassess
- If still confident in company, ignore price swings
- Add more slowly if you want more exposure

### Understanding Taxes on Your Trade

**Important:** Your first trade creates a tax event.

**If You Held 0 Days (Sold Same Day):**
- Called "day trading"
- Profits taxed as short-term capital gains (up to 37% tax rate)

**If You Held 1-365 Days (Sold Within a Year):**
- Called "short-term capital gains"
- Taxed as ordinary income (15%-37% depending on income)

**If You Held 365+ Days (Sold After a Year):**
- Called "long-term capital gains"
- Better tax rate (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income)
- Much more tax-efficient

**Practical Example:**
- You buy 10 shares at $195.53 = $1,955.30
- 1 month later, price is $210, you sell = $2,100
- Profit: $144.70
- Tax (assuming 22% short-term rate): $31.83
- Your net gain: $112.87

---if you held for 1 year and got long-term rates (15%):
- Tax: $21.71
- Your net gain: $122.99
- You keep $11 more just from waiting!

**For Your First Trade:**
- Don't worry about taxes yet
- Just understand holding longer is better (tax-wise)
- You'll handle taxes when selling (or at year-end filing)

### Emotional Response to Your First Trade

**This is normal:** You might feel excited, nervous, or anxious.

**Common feelings:**
- "Did I make a mistake?"
- "What if the price drops tomorrow?"
- "I wish I could buy more!"
- "I should sell before it drops!"

**These feelings are NORMAL.** Even experienced investors feel them.

**How to handle them:**
- Remember you researched this (you didn't pick randomly)
- A $100 position isn't going to make or break you
- Stock price moves every second - ignore daily noise
- If fundamentals don't change, company value hasn't changed
- First trade is about learning, not making money

### If Something Goes Wrong

**Scenario 1: Order Didn't Fill**
- Market orders almost always fill immediately
- If market closes after hours, order might wait for market open
- Check order status in "Order History"
- If says "Open" or "Pending," it will fill when market opens

**Scenario 2: Price Changed More Than Expected**
- Market volatility happens
- Especially around earnings, news, or market-wide events
- Don't panic
- This is why limit orders exist (next lesson)

**Scenario 3: Not Enough Cash**
- Platform should prevent this (won't let you order)
- If balance is tight, might be pending deposits
- Check "cash available" vs "cash pending"

**Scenario 4: Wrong Stock Purchased**
- If caught immediately, you might cancel the order
- If already filled, you can immediately sell
- No major problem, just lesson learned
- Verify ticker VERY carefully next time

**Scenario 5: Broker Is Down or App Crashes**
- Before you order, test the platform
- Try on paper trading first
- Have backup access method (web or mobile)
- If real issue, contact support

## Real-World Application

### Maria's First Trade

Maria has $2,000 to invest. She's been researching Netflix (NFLX).

**Her thought process:**
1. "I like Netflix, use the service, believe in the company"
2. "Netflix stock is around $210/share"
3. "I have $2,000, so I could buy about 9 shares"
4. "But I should diversify - what about other stocks?"
5. "I'll start small - buy 5 shares of Netflix ($1,050)"
6. "Save $950 for other stocks as I learn"

**Her trade:**
1. Opens Fidelity (her broker)
2. Clicks "Buy"
3. Enters "NFLX"
4. Selects "Market Order"
5. Enters "5" shares
6. Reviews order: 5 shares × $210.15 = $1,050.75
7. Clicks "Confirm"
8. Gets confirmation: Order filled at $210.18 per share
9. Total cost: $1,050.90

**After trade:**
- Maria now owns 5 shares of Netflix
- She has $949.10 left in cash
- Netflix price fluctuates
- One week later, it's at $208 (down $10/share = $50 loss on her position)
- She doesn't panic - she still believes in Netflix
- Plans to add more shares over time if price stays reasonable

### Roberto's Learning Approach

Roberto starts with $500. He's never invested before.

**His approach:**
1. "I'll make a tiny first trade just to learn the process"
2. "I don't want risk or complexity yet"
3. "I'll buy 1 share of an index ETF (SPY) at $450"
4. Executes the trade
5. Observes for 2 weeks - sees platform works fine, understands fees ($0)
6. Now confident, researches individual stocks
7. Makes his second trade buying 5 shares of a company he researched

**Why this works:**
- Roberto got comfortable with the platform first
- Low stakes (1 share is small investment)
- Proved to himself he could execute a trade
- Built confidence before larger positions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Verifying the Ticker
**Reality:** It's easy to order wrong stock, especially if they have similar tickers. Double-check the company name, not just ticker.

### Mistake #2: Using Market Order During High Volatility
**Reality:** In fast-moving markets, market order might fill at very different price than you expected. Use limit orders in volatile conditions (next lesson).

### Mistake #3: Buying During After-Hours Trading
**Reality:** Many brokers allow after-hours trading, but with worse prices and lower liquidity. Avoid for first trades. Trade during regular market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET).

### Mistake #4: Panic Selling After First Drop
**Reality:** All stocks drop sometimes. A 5% drop in a day is normal market behavior, not a disaster. Don't sell just because of price movement.

### Mistake #5: All-in First Trade
**Reality:** Don't invest your entire account in one stock. Start small, learn, then gradually add positions.

### Mistake #6: Not Keeping Trade Records
**Reality:** You'll need this for taxes. Screenshot or write down: stock bought, date, number of shares, price. Your broker keeps records, but having personal records helps.

### Mistake #7: Thinking First Trade = Get Rich Quick
**Reality:** Your first trade is about learning to execute, not making profits. Profits come from good decisions over time, not lucky first picks.

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Paper Trading (Risk-Free Practice)
**Before using real money, practice with "paper trading":**

1. Most brokers offer free paper trading
2. Your broker's website should have a "Practice Trading" or "Paper Trading" section

   - Buy 10 shares of AAPL
   - Buy 5 shares of MSFT
   - Buy 8 shares of GOOGL
4. Get comfortable with the interface
5. Understand exactly where each button is

### Exercise 2: Plan Your First Real Trade
Write down:
1. What stock will you buy? (ticker)

3. Why are you buying this stock? (2-3 sentences)
4. How long will you hold it? (timeframe)
5. What could make you sell it? (conditions)

### Exercise 3: Verification Checklist
Create a checklist you'll use before every trade:

```
BEFORE I TRADE:
[ ] Ticker correct? ________
[ ] Quantity correct? ________
[ ] Order type = Market? ________
[ ] Enough cash? ________
[ ] Understand why I'm buying? ________
[ ] Ready to submit? ________
```

Print this or keep in notes app. Use it before every trade.

### Exercise 4: First Trade (When Ready)
Once you've done paper trading and feel ready:

2. Wait for deposit to clear
3. Research and pick your first stock
4. Execute the trade following the steps above
5. Take a screenshot of confirmation
6. Keep the order confirmation

### Exercise 5: Monitor and Reflect
After your first real trade:
1. Watch it for one week
2. Note daily price changes (don't obsess, just observe)
3. Write a reflection:
   - How did you feel during the trade execution?
   - Were the steps easier or harder than expected?
   - What would you do differently next time?
   - What did you learn?
