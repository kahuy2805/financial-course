## Core Content

### What is a Stock Ticker?

A **stock ticker** is a symbol representing a specific company's stock.

**Examples:**
- AAPL = Apple Inc.
- MSFT = Microsoft
- GOOGL = Google (Alphabet)
- AMZN = Amazon
- TSLA = Tesla

Think of tickers like ZIP codes for stocks - they uniquely identify a company.

**How Tickers Work:**
- Usually 1-5 letters
- Each letter represents the stock
- Standardized so anyone can reference the same stock
- You use the ticker to buy/sell

**Why Tickers Matter:**
If you tried to say "buy Microsoft," your broker wouldn't know which company. "MSFT" is unambiguous and instant.

### Where to Find Stock Quotes

**Free websites:**
- Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com)
- Google Finance (google.com/finance)

- MarketWatch (marketwatch.com)
- Your broker's website

**How to find a quote:**
1. Go to Yahoo Finance
2. Type "AAPL" in the search box
3. Hit Enter
4. You'll see comprehensive quote data

### Understanding Stock Quote Data

Let's look at a real example. Here's what you see when you search for Apple (AAPL):

#### The Core Numbers

**Price (Last Price / Current Price)**
- **What it shows:** What the stock costs RIGHT NOW
- **Example:** $195.48
- **Why it matters:** This is what you'd pay per share if you bought today
- **Reality:** Updates constantly during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

**Change and % Change**
- **What it shows:** How much has the price moved today?
- **Example:** +2.45 (+1.27%)
- **Why it matters:** Quick sense of today's performance
- **Green = up, Red = down**
- **Note:** Only shows intraday movement (resets daily at market open)

**Open**
- **What it shows:** What price the stock opened at today
- **Example:** $193.20
- **Why it matters:** Tells you if the stock started strong or weak
- **Reality:** Opens every day at 9:30 AM ET when market opens

**High / Low (Today's High and Low)**
- **What it shows:** The highest and lowest price TODAY
- **Example:** High: $196.50 / Low: $192.80
- **Why it matters:** Shows the stock's range during the day
- **Analogy:** Like the temperature range (high/low) for the day

**52-Week High / 52-Week Low**
- **What it shows:** Highest/lowest price in the past year
- **Example:** High: $219.87 / Low: $164.35
- **Why it matters:** Shows if stock is near historic highs/lows
- **Valuable insight:**
  - If at 52-week high: Stock has been strong but might be expensive
  - If at 52-week low: Stock has struggled but might be cheap

**Volume**
- **What it shows:** How many shares traded today
- **Example:** 52,341,000 (52.3 million shares)
- **Why it matters:** Shows liquidity and interest in the stock
- **What it means:**
  - High volume = Easy to buy/sell, stock actively traded
  - Low volume = Hard to buy/sell, fewer traders interested
- **Rule of thumb:** Volume over 1 million shares/day is liquid enough for most traders

**Market Cap (Market Capitalization)**
- **What it shows:** Total value of company = Share Price × Total Shares
- **Example:** $3.2 Trillion for Apple
- **Why it matters:** Shows company size
- **Size categories:**
  - Large-cap: Over $10 billion (established companies)
  - Mid-cap: $2-10 billion (growing companies)
  - Small-cap: Under $2 billion (emerging companies)

**P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**
- **What it shows:** Price per dollar of earnings
- **Formula:** Stock Price ÷ Annual Earnings Per Share
- **Example:** P/E of 25 means you pay $25 for every $1 of earnings
- **Why it matters:** Shows if stock is cheap or expensive
- **What it means:**
  - P/E of 15 = Cheaper (you pay less per earnings dollar)
  - P/E of 50 = More expensive (you pay more per earnings dollar)
  - Industry matters: Tech stocks naturally have higher P/E than utilities
- **Caveat:** Not the only valuation measure; use with other metrics

**Dividend and Yield**
- **What it shows:** Regular payments to shareholders + percentage return
- **Example:** Dividend $0.96 per share, Yield 1.2%
- **Why it matters:** Extra income from owning the stock
- **How it works:**
  - Company makes $1 billion profit
  - Decides to pay $0.96/share to shareholders quarterly
  - If you own 100 shares, you receive $96/year
- **Yield:** Annual dividend ÷ Stock price
  - Higher yield = More income per dollar invested
  - But: Very high yields can indicate trouble (stock fell, dividend is unsustainable)

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
- **What it shows:** Company's profit per share
- **Example:** $8.47 per share
- **Why it matters:** Shows profitability; used in P/E calculation
- **Trend matters:** Growing EPS = Good sign

### Understanding the Quote Layout (Real Example)

Imagine you search for Apple (AAPL) on Yahoo Finance. You see:

```
AAPL - Apple Inc.
$195.48
+2.45 (+1.27%)

SUMMARY TAB:
Previous Close: $193.03
Open: $193.20
Bid: $195.47 × 100
Ask: $195.48 × 200
52-Week High: $219.87
52-Week Low: $164.35
Market Cap: 3.2T
P/E Ratio: 28.4
Dividend Yield: 0.48%
EPS: 6.89
```

**What this tells you:**
- Apple stock costs $195.48 right now
- It's up $2.45 today (1.27%)
- It opened at $193.20 today
- In the past year, it ranged from $164.35 to $219.87
- It's currently near the high (strong year)
- Market thinks it's worth $3.2 trillion total
- You pay $28.40 for every $1 of earnings
- It pays a small dividend (0.48%)

### The Bid and Ask

These two numbers are CRUCIAL for actually buying:

**Bid**
- **What it shows:** Best price someone will PAY for the stock right now
- **Example:** $195.47
- **Meaning:** If you want to sell, someone will pay $195.47

**Ask**
- **What it shows:** Best price someone will ACCEPT if you want to buy
- **Example:** $195.48
- **Meaning:** If you want to buy, you'll pay $195.48

**The Key Difference:**
- Bid is what you'd GET if you sell
- Ask is what you'd PAY if you buy
- The difference ($0.01) is called the **bid-ask spread**

**Why They're Different:**
Think like a car dealer:
- They BID $20,000 for your used car (what they'll pay you)
- They ASK $25,000 for a similar car on the lot (what you'd pay)
- The $5,000 difference is their profit (bid-ask spread)

### Reading a Quote Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Identify the Ticker**
- Confirm you're looking at the right company

**Step 2: Check the Price**
- Know what it costs right now

**Step 3: Look at Change**
- Is it up or down today? By how much?

**Step 4: Check Volume**
- Is it liquid (can you buy/sell easily)?

**Step 5: Review 52-Week Range**
- Is it near highs (strong) or lows (weak)?

**Step 6: Look at P/E Ratio**
- Is it expensive or cheap compared to earnings?

**Step 7: Check Dividend (if interested in income)**
- Does it pay dividends? How much?

### Real-World Example: Comparing Two Stocks

Let's compare two stocks to show how to read quotes:

**Stock A: Large Mature Company**
- Price: $150
- P/E: 18
- Dividend Yield: 2.5%
- 52-Week High: $160 (near high)
- Volume: 5 million/day
- Interpretation: Stable, profitable, pays income, liquid

**Stock B: Growth Company**
- Price: $85
- P/E: 45
- Dividend Yield: 0% (no dividend)
- 52-Week High: $120 (near low)
- Volume: 200,000/day (less liquid)
- Interpretation: Growing but expensive, no income, less liquid, fallen significantly

**Comparison:**
- Stock A = Established, profitable, stable
- Stock B = Growth potential but higher risk

Different investors choose differently based on goals.

## Real-World Application

### How This Applies Today

**Scenario 1: Quick Check Before Buying**
You're thinking about buying Apple. You:
1. Search AAPL on your broker
2. See it's at $195.48 (price)
3. Check volume: 52M shares (very liquid, easy to buy)
4. See P/E of 28.4 (moderate price, not cheap or expensive)
5. Note 52-week high is $219.87 (stock is down from recent highs)
6. Make decision based on your research

**Scenario 2: Comparing Dividend Stocks**
You want to buy dividend-paying stocks for income. You check:
- Stock A: 3.5% yield (good income)
- Stock B: 5.2% yield (great income, but is it sustainable?)
- Stock C: 2.1% yield (lower income)

You research Stock B's dividend history - if it cut dividends before or earnings are declining, the high yield might not last. You choose Stock A instead.

**Scenario 3: Recognizing Trends**
You see a stock:
- 52-week high: $100
- Current price: $45
- Down 55% for the year

Is this a bargain or a disaster? You need to:
- Check if company fundamentals collapsed
- Research why stock fell
- Is P/E still reasonable?
- Use the quote data to inform research, not make decision alone

### Key Insight: Quote is Data, Not Recommendation

**Important:** A stock quote shows WHAT the stock is trading at, not WHETHER you should buy it.

Many beginners see a cheap price and buy without research. That's backwards.

Use quotes to:
- Track stocks you're researching
- Understand relative valuation
- Compare similar stocks
- Notice significant moves

Don't use quotes to:
- Make buy/sell decisions alone
- Judge quality
- Predict direction

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Confusing Price with Value
**Reality:** A $20 stock isn't "cheaper" than a $100 stock. Price alone means nothing. Always look at P/E ratio or other valuation metrics.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Volume
**Reality:** A great stock with 5,000 shares/day volume might be hard to sell when you want to. Volume matters more than price.

### Mistake #3: Overweighting One Day's Change
**Reality:** A stock down 10% today might recover tomorrow. One day of data is noise. Look at 52-week range and trends.

### Mistake #4: Not Understanding Bid-Ask Spread
**Reality:** The asking price you'll pay is higher than the bid (what you'd receive if selling). Budget for this small cost.

### Mistake #5: Chasing High Dividend Yields Without Research
**Reality:** A 10% dividend yield is red flag, not a treasure. Usually means:
- Stock price crashed and dividend is unsustainable
- Company is dying but dividend hasn't been cut yet
- Always research why dividend is so high

### Mistake #6: Judging Stock Quality by Current Price
**Reality:** A stock at $200 isn't better than $50. Use market cap, P/E, and fundamentals to judge quality.

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Find and Read a Quote
1. Go to Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com)
2. Search for: AAPL (Apple)
3. Write down these numbers:
   - Current price
   - Today's change
   - P/E ratio
   - 52-week high and low
   - Dividend yield
   - Market cap
   - Volume

### Exercise 2: Compare Three Stocks
Search for these stocks and create a comparison table:
- MSFT (Microsoft)
- GOOGL (Google)
- AMZN (Amazon)

For each, record:
- Current price
- P/E ratio
- Dividend yield
- Market cap
- 52-week high/low
- Volume

### Exercise 3: Analyze Current Price Position
For the three stocks above, calculate:
- What % of the 52-week range is the current price?
- Formula: (Current - Low) / (High - Low) × 100
- Is it near the high, low, or middle?

**Example:** If 52-week low is $100, high is $200, current is $150:
- ($150 - $100) / ($200 - $100) × 100 = 50%
- Stock is at the midpoint of its range

### Exercise 4: Dividend Analysis
If you're interested in dividend income:
1. Search for: KO (Coca-Cola), JNJ (Johnson & Johnson), PG (Procter & Gamble)
2. Write down their dividend yields
3. Which pays the most income?
4. Research why (earnings, payout ratio, dividend history)

### Exercise 5: Reflection
Write a few sentences about:
- Which quote data is most important to you?
- What data are you still confused about?
- How would you use quote data before buying a stock?
