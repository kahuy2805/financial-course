## Exercise 5.1: Your Emotional Trigger Audit

### Purpose
Identify which emotions dominate your trading decision-making and their specific triggers.

### Instructions

**Part 1: Emotion Frequency Audit**

Rate how often you experience each emotion in trading contexts (1 = never, 5 = constantly):

```
HOPE
□ 1 - Never feel this when looking for trades
□ 2 - Rarely
□ 3 - Sometimes
□ 4 - Frequently
□ 5 - Constantly (always excited about potential setups)

FEAR
□ 1 - Never worry about losses
□ 2 - Rarely worried
□ 3 - Sometimes anxious
□ 4 - Frequently anxious
□ 5 - Constantly anxious about positions

GREED
□ 1 - Never want more than my targets
□ 2 - Rarely tempted to extend targets
□ 3 - Sometimes consider moving targets
□ 4 - Frequently want to hold longer
□ 5 - Constantly want to hold for more profit

REGRET
□ 1 - Accept outcomes easily
□ 2 - Rarely second-guess
□ 3 - Sometimes frustrated with exits
□ 4 - Frequently upset about "leaving money on table"
□ 5 - Constantly obsessing over missed opportunities

CONFIDENCE
□ 1 - Never confident in my system
□ 2 - Rarely feel confident
□ 3 - Sometimes confident
□ 4 - Frequently confident
□ 5 - Always confident (maybe overconfident)

CONFUSION
□ 1 - Always clear on what to do
□ 2 - Rarely confused
□ 3 - Sometimes unsure about entries
□ 4 - Frequently unsure
□ 5 - Constantly confused about what trades to take
```

**Analysis:**
- Your highest-rated emotions are your DOMINANT EMOTIONS
- These are where you need discipline and rules most

**Example:** If GREED and REGRET are both 5, you need:
- Strict profit target rules (to prevent greed)
- Clear trailing stop rules (to prevent revenge trading from regret)

**Part 2: Trigger Mapping**

For each of your top 3 emotions, identify what triggers them:

```
DOMINANT EMOTION #1: ______________

Trigger 1: _________________________
Example: When a stock breaks above resistance level

Trigger 2: _________________________
Example: After I take a loss

Trigger 3: _________________________
Example: When I see other traders' winning trades

Prevention Strategy for each trigger:
Trigger 1 prevention: ________________
Trigger 2 prevention: ________________
Trigger 3 prevention: ________________


DOMINANT EMOTION #2: ______________
[Same format as above]

DOMINANT EMOTION #3: ______________
[Same format as above]
```

### Deliverable
Write a 1-page "Emotional Profile" describing:
1. Your three most dominant emotions in trading
2. What triggers each one
3. How you'll prevent each trigger from derailing your plan

## Exercise 5.2: Trading Rules Clarity Test

### Purpose
Ensure your trading rules are clear enough to follow without ambiguity.

### Instructions

**Part 1: Write Your Three Core Rules**

Rule 1: Entry Rule
```
When I will enter a trade:
_________________________________
_________________________________

This rule is clear enough that:
□ Someone else could follow it without asking questions
□ I could execute it without thinking
□ It specifies exactly what conditions must be met

If unchecked, rewrite more specifically.
```

**Example of VAGUE rule:** "Buy when the setup looks good"
**Example of CLEAR rule:** "Buy only when: (1) Price closes above 20-day MA, (2) Volume > 2x 20-day avg, (3) RSI > 55, (4) MACD positive. All four conditions must be met."

Rule 2: Stop Loss Rule
```
When I will take my stop loss:
_________________________________
_________________________________

Is your stop loss automatic:
□ Yes (I set a stop loss order at my broker)
□ No (I monitor and exit manually)

If no, commit to using automatic stops.
```

Rule 3: Profit Target Rule
```
When I will take my profits:
_________________________________
_________________________________

Are your targets automatic:
□ Yes (I set limit orders at my broker)
□ No (I monitor and exit manually)

If no, commit to using automatic targets.
```

**Part 2: The Ambiguity Test**

Read your rules to someone else. Can they execute your trade plan exactly as you've described it?

If they ask clarifying questions, your rules need to be more specific.

### Deliverable
Written rules for entry, stop loss, and profit target that pass the clarity test (someone else could follow them).

## Exercise 5.3: Discipline Scoreboard (7-Day Challenge)

### Purpose
Measure your current discipline baseline and track improvement.

### Instructions

Create a daily scoreboard for 7 trading days:

```
DISCIPLINE SCOREBOARD - WEEK OF: __________

DAILY CHECKLIST:
Complete this each trading day. Circle your score.

MONDAY ____:____

```

### Deliverable

## Exercise 5.4: Your Trading Journal Setup

### Purpose
Establish a journaling system you'll actually maintain.

### Instructions

**Part 1: Choose Your Format**

```
Will you journal on:
□ Paper (physical notebook)
□ Digital (spreadsheet)
□ Hybrid (paper notes + digital summary)
□ Trading platform's journal feature

Which format are you most likely to maintain consistently?
Answer: ___________________

Why: ___________________________
```

**Part 2: Set Up Your Journal**

If digital:
- Create a spreadsheet with columns for:
  - Date, Symbol, Entry, Exit, Profit/Loss, Setup Type, Discipline Score, Notes, Lesson

If paper:
- Get a notebook
- Write the column headers at the top of the first page
- Practice filling in a sample trade entry

If hybrid:
- Get a notebook for immediate post-trade notes
- Plan to transfer to spreadsheet each evening

**Part 3: Practice Entry**

Take a past trade you made (real or paper) and create a journal entry using your format.

Does it feel natural? Can you record all necessary information efficiently?

If your format is too complex, simplify it. You'll only maintain a system that's easy to use.

### Deliverable
Set up journal system and complete one practice entry demonstrating all fields.

## Exercise 5.5: Fear and Greed Case Study Analysis

### Purpose
See how fear and greed play out in real scenarios and plan your responses.

### Instructions

**Scenario 1: The Fear of Missing Out**

```
You identified a stock breaking out above its 50-day moving average.
However, it doesn't match your entry criteria because volume is only
1.5x average (your rule requires 2x+).

Your rule says: SKIP
Your brain screams: "This will be a 10% winner and I'm sitting on sidelines!"

What will you do:
□ Skip the trade (follow rules)
□ Enter anyway (break rules)

If you skip, how will you handle the FOMO that follows:
_________________________________

If the stock goes up 10% and you didn't trade it, will that hurt you:
□ Yes, I'll feel regret and want to revenge trade
□ No, I'll remember that I saved my capital for better setups

What you'll tell yourself:
_________________________________
_________________________________
```

**Scenario 2: The Greed of Holding Too Long**

```
You entered at $100 with a profit target of $102.
The stock hit $101.50 and you're up $150.
You think: "This could go to $105. Why sell at $102?"

Your original risk/reward calculation said $102 was your target.
But you want more.

What will you do:
□ Sell at $102 (follow plan)
□ Hold for $105 (follow greed)

If you hold and it drops back to $100, you'll have:
□ A loss (and regret)
□ Still broken even (if you exit at $100)

What's the psychological cost of watching your $150 profit disappear?
_________________________________

This is the cost of greed. Is it worth it?
□ Yes
□ No

What you'll tell yourself when tempted to move targets:
_________________________________
_________________________________
```

**Scenario 3: The Fear of Taking a Stop Loss**

```
You're down $200 on a trade and your stop loss is hit.
But the stock "looks like it's bouncing."
Your brain says: "If I just wait 5 minutes, it might recover."

Your stop loss rule is non-negotiable at $X price.
The stock is at $X.01 (just hit your stop).

What will you do:
□ Exit immediately at $X (follow stop)
□ Hold and wait 5 minutes (avoid loss)

If you hold and the stock drops further, your loss becomes:
□ Larger (costs you extra $500-$2000)
□ Still manageable if it recovers (risky!)

The true cost of not taking a stop loss on time is:
_________________________________

Historical reality: How often does a stock recover after hitting your stop?
Answer: Less than 50% of the time. You're betting on unlikely recovery.

What you'll tell yourself when tempted to move stops:
_________________________________
_________________________________
```

**Scenario 4: The Greed of Revenge Trading**

```
You took a loss of $400 on a trade.
You're frustrated and want to make it back quickly.
You see another trade opportunity (maybe not ideal).
You think: "I'll make $600 on this next one and I'm net +$200 for the day."

But this trade doesn't meet your criteria. It's a desperation trade.

What will you do:
□ Skip it (follow discipline)
□ Take it (revenge trade)

If you revenge trade and lose another $300, you've now:
□ Made back nothing and lost $700 total
□ Created a psychological spiral of wanting to make it back even more

The cost of one revenge trade compounds when you take revenge trades #2, #3...

What you'll tell yourself to prevent revenge trading:
_________________________________
_________________________________

Will you commit to: No trading for the rest of the day after a significant loss?
□ Yes
□ No

Why or why not: ____________________________
```

### Deliverable
Written responses to all 4 scenarios showing you understand fear/greed patterns and how you'll handle them.

## Exercise 5.6: The Loss Resilience Test

### Purpose
Build psychological resilience to losses before they happen in real trading.

### Instructions

**Part 1: Loss Expectation Setting**

```
If you have a 55% win rate system:
- Out of 20 trades, how many will you lose: _____
- Out of 100 trades, how many will you lose: _____
- Is this normal or a sign of failure: ___________

If you take 10 losses in a row:
- % of account lost (if risking 1% per trade): _____
- Is this possible: □ Yes  □ No
- Is your account still alive: □ Yes  □ No
- Should you keep trading: □ Yes  □ No

Accepting losses is accepting that trading has variance.
Do you accept this:
□ Yes, I understand 40-50% of my trades will lose
□ No, I expect to win most of my trades
□ Partially, I'm still struggling with this
```

**Part 2: The Imaginary Loss Scenario**

Imagine these scenarios:

```
SCENARIO A: You take a loss of $500
Your account: $10,000
Your reaction (scale 1-5):
1 = I'm upset but handling it fine
5 = I'm devastated and want to quit

Your score: _____

If you scored 4-5, you need to:
□ Reduce position sizing to feel safer
□ Build up more account capital before trading
□ Work on acceptance through journaling

SCENARIO B: You have 3 losses in a row (-$1,500 total)
Your account: $10,000 (now $8,500)
Your reaction (scale 1-5):

Your score: _____

What's your plan if this happens:
_________________________________
_________________________________

Will you:
□ Quit trading
□ Trade more to make it back (revenge trading)
□ Continue normal trading
□ Take a break and review your system

Best answer: Continue normal trading (variance is normal)

SCENARIO C: You have a losing month (-$3,000)
Your account: $10,000 (now $7,000)
Your reaction:

Your score: _____

This is a 30% loss in one month. How will you respond:
_________________________________

This is a critical question. Most traders quit here.
If you want to succeed, you must have a plan for losing months.

Your commitment:
"Even if I lose $3,000 in a month, I will:"
_________________________________
_________________________________
_________________________________
```

**Part 3: The Loss Journal Prep**

Before your first loss occurs, write a "Loss Response Letter" to yourself:

```
LETTER TO MYSELF (To be read after a loss)

[Your name],

Today I took a loss of $______. I feel ________________.

But I want to remember:

1. This loss is normal. Every trader loses. Losing ______%
   of my account in one trade is expected variance.

2. The cost of this loss is valuable. It will teach me
   _________________ about my system or discipline.

3. I will not revenge trade. I will wait until tomorrow
   to review this trade in my journal.

4. My system still works. One loss doesn't prove my system
   is broken. I need 20+ similar situations to evaluate.

5. I am not a failure. I am a trader who:
   - Has taken hundreds of trades
   - Wins 60% of the time
   - Takes losses as information, not personal failure

6. Tomorrow I will:
   - Review this trade in my journal
   - Extract the lesson
   - Continue normal trading

Remember: You will have many more losses. This is one of them.
Stay disciplined.

Your signature: ___________   Date: ___________
```

### Deliverable
Completed loss resilience test and loss response letter.
