## What Makes This Different

Most trading courses skip psychology or treat it as optional.

We don't. Because:

1. **It's the bottleneck.** You can have a perfect system with 70% win rate. But if your psychology breaks down, you'll still lose money.

2. **It's trainable.** Unlike luck or talent, you can develop better trading psychology through deliberate practice.

3. **It compounds.** Small psychology improvements compound into massive profit improvements over years.

4. **Most people skip it.** This gives you an unfair advantage over other traders.

## Your Commitment

This chapter requires 40-60 hours of work. Many people won't do it.

You're about to commit to it.

**This commitment will define your trading career.**

If you do this right:
- Year 1: 10-20% annual returns
- Year 2+: 20-50% annual returns
- Career average: 5-10x your initial capital

If you skip it:
- Year 1: Probably -20% to -50% (account destruction)
- Year 2: Either quit or start over with better psychology
- Career: Most traders never recover from early losses

**The choice is yours. The time to choose is now.**
