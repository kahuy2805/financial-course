# Lesson 13.4: Tax-Efficient Trading Strategies

## Overview
Taxes are your biggest drag on returns—often larger than investment fees. A successful investor manages tax liability as carefully as asset allocation. The IRS wants its cut, but you can be smart about when and how you pay.

## Tax Basics for Traders

### Capital Gains Types

**Short-Term Capital Gains (Assets held ≤ 1 year)**
```
Tax Rate: Ordinary income rates (10%-37% federal, plus state)
Example: Sell stock after 6 months for $5,000 gain
         Your marginal rate: 24%
         Tax owed: $5,000 × 24% = $1,200

Effective Rate Examples (Federal Only):
$50,000 income:  22% tax = $1,100 on $5,000 gain
$100,000 income: 24% tax = $1,200 on $5,000 gain
$300,000 income: 35% tax = $1,750 on $5,000 gain
(Plus state taxes, additional 3.8% Net Investment Tax)
```

**Long-Term Capital Gains (Assets held > 1 year)**
```
Tax Rates: 0%, 15%, or 20% (much better!)
Example: Sell stock after 14 months for $5,000 gain
         Your bracket: 15%
         Tax owed: $5,000 × 15% = $750 (vs. $1,200 short-term)
         SAVINGS: $450 per $5,000 gain!

Rate Brackets (2024, federal):
0% rate:    Income up to ~$47,000 (single)
15% rate:   Income $47,000-$518,900
20% rate:   Income over $518,900

Effective Tax Savings:
Short-term 24% → Long-term 15% = 9% saving per dollar
Short-term 35% → Long-term 20% = 15% saving per dollar
Short-term 37% → Long-term 20% = 17% saving per dollar
```

### Dividend Tax Treatment

**Qualified Dividends** (from US stocks held 60+ days)
```
Taxed as long-term capital gains (0%, 15%, or 20%)
Most common for dividend stocks
```

**Non-Qualified Dividends** (from REITs, preferred stock, foreign stocks)
```
Taxed as ordinary income (10%-37%)
More expensive tax-wise
```

**Tax Impact Examples:**
```
$5,000 in Qualified Dividends @ 15% bracket:  $750 tax
$5,000 in Non-Qualified Dividends @ 24%:      $1,200 tax
DIFFERENCE: $450 (36% more expensive!)
```

## Tax-Loss Harvesting: The #1 Tax Strategy

### Basic Concept
```
Definition: Sell losing positions to realize losses,
which offset gains elsewhere

Example:
Gain from Apple stock: +$3,000 (taxable)
Loss from Tesla position: -$2,000 (deductible)
Net gain: $1,000 (only this is taxed)
Tax savings: $2,000 × 24% = $480!
```

### Harvesting Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Losses**
```
Portfolio Review:
Position        Cost Basis   Current Value   Gain/Loss
Apple          $10,000      $11,500         +$1,500 (DON'T harvest)
Tesla          $5,000       $3,500          -$1,500 (HARVEST)
Google         $8,000       $7,200          -$800 (HARVEST)
Microsoft      $6,000       $9,000          +$3,000 (DON'T harvest)
```

**Step 2: Calculate Offset Potential**
```
Available losses: $1,500 + $800 = $2,300
Planned gains (from selling Apple): $1,500

Strategy:
1. Harvest Tesla loss ($1,500) → Offset Apple gain
2. Save Tesla loss ($800) for next year

Result: Zero tax on the $1,500 gain!
```

**Step 3: Execute Harvest Trades**
```
Action Sequence:
1. Sell Tesla at $3,500 (realize $1,500 loss)
2. Wait 31+ days
3. Buy similar (but not identical) stock/ETF
   Alternative: Buy different diversified tech holding

4. Sell Apple at $11,500 (realize $1,500 gain)
5. Total tax: $0 (loss offset gain)

Cost: Small commission (typically $0-5) and small price drift
```

### Wash Sale Rule (Critical!)

**The Rule:**
```
Can't deduct a loss if you buy substantially identical
security within 30 days BEFORE or 30 days AFTER the sale

If you violate: Loss is deferred (added to new cost basis)
Does NOT go away, just postponed
```

**30-Day Window Visualization:**
```
           30 days    SELL    30 days
           BEFORE    DATE    AFTER
           |---------|--------|---------|
    Can't buy    Loss harvest    Can't buy
    similar stock date here    similar stock

Total "safe zone": Sell, wait 31 days, buy same security
```

**Avoiding Wash Sales:**
```
Sold at loss:       DO NOT BUY:          CAN BUY:
Apple stock         Apple stock          Microsoft (diff company)
                    Apple options        Tech ETF (different holdings)
                                        Apple in DIFFERENT account

S&P 500 Index      S&P 500 Index        Total Market Index
(VOO)              (SPY, IVV)           (VTI) - different index
                                        Russell 3000 (broader)

High-yield bonds   Same bond ETF        Different bond ETF
                   Same issuer bonds    Intermediate bonds
```

## Asset Location Strategy: Where to Hold What

### The Tax-Efficiency Hierarchy

**Stocks and Stock Funds** (low income, tax-efficient)
- Taxed only on gains (when sold) and dividends (if qualified)
- Best for: Tax-deferred accounts OR taxable if held long-term
- Location: Roth IRA, 401(k), or Taxable accounts

**Bonds and Bond Funds** (high income, inefficient)
- Taxed as ordinary income every year on interest
- Worst in taxable accounts
- Best Location: Traditional IRA, 401(k), tax-deferred accounts

**REITs** (high income, taxed as ordinary income)
- Monthly/quarterly distributions taxed as ordinary income
- Disastrous in taxable accounts
- Best location: IRA, 401(k), or tax-deferred

**Dividend Stocks** (moderate income, qualified divs get preference)
- Qualified dividends are tax-efficient
- Can hold in taxable accounts (vs REITs/Bonds)
- Best: Still better in tax-deferred accounts, but acceptable taxable

**Growth Stocks** (minimal income, capital appreciation)
- No annual tax drag if held long-term
- Most tax-efficient in taxable accounts
- Can hold in taxable and defer taxes decades

### Implementation Example

```
Total Portfolio: $500,000

Tax-Deferred Accounts (IRA, 401k): $250,000
- 50% Bonds: $125,000 (taxable interest is OK here)
- 30% REITs: $75,000 (high distributions OK here)
- 20% Dividend stocks: $50,000 (filler)

Taxable Account: $250,000
- 60% Growth stocks: $150,000 (buy and hold, minimal taxes)
- 25% Dividend stocks: $62,500 (qualified dividends preferred)
- 15% Municipal bonds: $37,500 (tax-free income!)

Result: Interest and REIT distributions in tax-deferred,
        Growth in taxable (minimal annual taxes)
```

## Holding Period Management

### Timing Sales for Tax Efficiency

**Strategy 1: Hold Until Qualified (1+ year)**
```
Bought: January 5, 2024
Sale Date Options:
- January 4, 2025: SHORT-TERM (one day too early!)
- January 5, 2025: LONG-TERM (exactly 1 year, tax-efficient)

Tax Difference:
If gain is $5,000:
- Short-term (24% rate): $1,200 tax
- Long-term (15% rate): $750 tax
- SAVINGS: $450 (just by waiting 1 day!)
```

**Strategy 2: "Sell in December, Buy in January"**
```
December (Current Year):
1. Sell winners to harvest long-term gains
2. Realize losses from underwater positions
3. Net gains reduced or eliminated

January (New Year):
1. Reinvest in similar holdings
2. Start new 1-year holding period
3. Portfolio remains similar, taxes minimized
```

**Strategy 3: Stagger Sales Across Years**
```
Problem: Realized $30,000 in gains in one year
Solution: Spread sales across two years

Year 1: Sell winners with $15,000 in gains
        Harvest losses to offset
        Net tax: Minimal

Year 2: Sell remaining winners with $15,000 in gains
        Lower overall tax impact
```

## Tax-Advantaged Accounts Priority

### Account Hierarchy for Deposits
```
PRIORITY 1: Take full employer 401(k) match
            (Free money! Don't leave it)

PRIORITY 2: Max out HSA if available
            (Triple tax advantage)
            - Pre-tax contribution
            - Tax-free growth
            - Tax-free medical withdrawals

PRIORITY 3: Max out Roth IRA
            ($7,000/year, $8,000 if 50+)
            (Tax-free growth forever)

PRIORITY 4: Max out 401(k) or solo 401(k)
            ($23,500/year, more if self-employed)
            (Deductible, tax-free growth)

PRIORITY 5: Contribute to taxable account
            (Use after tax-advantaged maxed)
```

### Account Contribution Limits (2024)
```
401(k):              $23,500 ($31,000 if 50+)
IRA (Roth/Trad):    $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
HSA (Individual):   $4,150 ($5,150 if 55+)
Solo 401(k):        $69,000 (self-employed)
SEP IRA:            25% of net self-emp income
Mega Backdoor Roth: Up to $69,000/year
```

## Tax Reporting and Documentation

### Required Records
```
For each transaction:
- Purchase date
- Cost basis (price paid + commissions)
- Sale date
- Sale price
- Dividend dates and amounts
- Interest received
- 1099 forms from brokers
```

### Using Cost Basis Methods

**First-In, First-Out (FIFO)**
```
Bought 100 shares at $50
Bought 100 shares at $60
Bought 100 shares at $70
Sell 100 shares

FIFO assumes: Sold the $50 shares
Result: Biggest gain! Higher taxes
```

**Specific Identification**
```
Bought 100 shares at $50
Bought 100 shares at $60
Bought 100 shares at $70
Sell 100 shares: "Specifically sell the $70 shares"

Result: Smallest gain! Lower taxes
Cost: Must track and declare specific lots

Most brokers now allow this (select at sale)
```

**Average Cost Basis**
```
300 shares worth ($50+$60+$70)/3 = $60 average

When selling 100 shares:
Cost basis: $60 × 100 = $6,000

Results: Middle ground between FIFO and specific ID
```

### Tax Form 8949 and Schedule D

```
Form 8949: Reports each sale and capital gain/loss
Schedule D: Summary of gains/losses

Needed for:
- Stock/fund sales
- Option exercises
- Dividend income
- Interest income (if >$1,500)
```

## Capital Loss Carryforward

### Using Losses in Future Years

```
Situation:
Year 1: Realized $8,000 in losses, $3,000 in gains
        Net loss: $5,000
        Can deduct: $3,000 against income
        Carryforward loss: $2,000

Year 2: Realized $1,000 in gains
        Use $1,000 of carryforward loss
        Net taxable gain: $0
        Remaining carryforward: $1,000

Year 3: No gains, $5,000 regular income
        Use $3,000 carryforward loss (annual limit)
        Remaining carryforward: -$2,000
```

**Key Rules:**
```
- Can deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income/year
- Excess carries forward indefinitely
- Use shortest holding period losses first (more valuable)
- Can offset unlimited capital gains
```
