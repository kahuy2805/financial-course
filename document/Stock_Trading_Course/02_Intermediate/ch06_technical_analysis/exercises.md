## Section 1: Moving Averages (Lesson 6.1)

### Question 1.1
Calculate the 5-day simple moving average for these closing prices:

$100, $102, $99, $101, $103

**Answer:** ($100 + $102 + $99 + $101 + $103) ÷ 5 = $101

### Question 1.2
You see a stock with:
- Price: $150
- 20-day EMA: $145
- 50-day EMA: $140
- 200-day SMA: $135

Is this stock in an uptrend or downtrend? Why?

**Answer:** Strong uptrend. Price is above all moving averages (20 > 50 > 200), which shows bullish alignment across all timeframes.

### Question 1.3
What does it mean when the 50-day EMA crosses above the 200-day SMA?

**Answer:** Golden Cross - a bullish signal indicating momentum is shifting from bearish to bullish. Often marks the beginning of a significant uptrend.

### Question 1.4
You're watching a stock in an uptrend. It pulls back to touch the 50-day EMA and bounces up. What does this tell you?

**Answer:** The uptrend is healthy and strong. The 50-day EMA is providing support, and buyers are stepping in at this level. This is an excellent entry point for a new long position.

---

## Section 2: RSI (Lesson 6.2)

### Question 2.1
A stock has an RSI of 75. What does this indicate, and what action might you consider?

**Answer:** Overbought condition. Price has risen too much too fast. Consider taking profits, tightening stop losses, or preparing to short/sell. Watch for reversal signals.

### Question 2.2
You notice:
- Price is making new highs
- But RSI is making lower highs

What is this called, and what does it suggest?

**Answer:** Bearish Divergence. Suggests the uptrend is losing momentum. Fewer buyers are pushing price higher. A reversal down is likely coming.

### Question 2.3
Two stocks are both in uptrends:
- Stock A: RSI bounces off 40 (then rallies)
- Stock B: RSI bounces off 60 (then rallies)

Which bounce is more bullish? Why?

**Answer:** Stock B is more bullish. RSI bouncing off 60 during an uptrend shows the uptrend is strong and healthy. RSI at 40 in an uptrend shows the pullback is deeper and less healthy. Stock B is the safer buy.

### Question 2.4
An RSI reading of 50. Is this bullish, bearish, or neutral?

**Answer:** Neutral. RSI 50 is the exact midpoint between overbought (70) and oversold (30). Neither bullish nor bearish. Needs additional confirmation from price action or other indicators.

---

## Section 3: MACD (Lesson 6.3)

### Question 3.1
What are the three components of MACD, and what does each one show?

**Answer:**
1. **MACD Line**: Shows momentum (12-EMA minus 26-EMA)
2. **Signal Line**: Smoothed MACD (9-EMA of MACD), used for crossovers
3. **Histogram**: Visual bars showing difference between MACD and signal line

### Question 3.2
You see:
- MACD is below zero
- MACD is below the signal line
- Histogram bars are shrinking

What does this tell you about momentum?

**Answer:** Weak and weakening momentum in a downtrend. The downtrend is losing power. A reversal up might be coming soon.

### Question 3.3
MACD crosses above zero. What signal is this?

**Answer:** Strong bullish signal. The 12-period EMA is now stronger than the 26-period EMA. Momentum is shifting from bearish to bullish. This often marks the start of a significant uptrend.

### Question 3.4
You're in a long trade and see:
- MACD starts to turn down
- Histogram bars start shrinking
- MACD is approaching the signal line

What should you do?

**Answer:** Tighten your stop loss or prepare to exit. Momentum is weakening, which could lead to a pullback or reversal. This is an early warning sign before MACD actually crosses below the signal line.

## Section 4: Bollinger Bands (Lesson 6.4)

### Question 4.1
In an established uptrend:
- Price drops to the lower Bollinger Band
- A hammer candlestick forms
- Volume increases

What should you do?

**Answer:** BUY. This is a classic bounce setup. Price has reached support (lower band), reversal candlestick confirmed the bounce, and volume shows buying interest. Excellent entry for a long position.

### Question 4.2
What does it mean when Bollinger Bands are very close together (squeeze)?

**Answer:** Low volatility, tight range. Price is locked in a narrow band. A big move is coming soon. The tighter the squeeze, the more violent the breakout. Prepare for an explosive move in either direction.

### Question 4.3
Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with volume. Is this bullish or bearish?

**Answer:** Could be either. Breaking above the upper band shows extreme strength, which can mean:
- Breakout continues (very bullish)
- Overextension before pullback (setup for reversal)

Need to check trend context and watch for reversal signals. Don't automatically assume continuation.

### Question 4.4
You're trading a stock that's in a downtrend. It rallies and touches the upper Bollinger Band. What's your setup?

**Answer:** SHORT setup. In downtrends, the upper band acts as resistance. Price touching it is overbought. Look for a reversal candlestick (shooting star) to confirm, then enter a short position with stop loss above the band.

## Section 5: Fibonacci Retracement (Lesson 6.5)

### Question 5.1
A stock rallies from $100 to $150, then pulls back. Calculate the key Fibonacci retracement levels.

**Answer:**
- Move size: $150 - $100 = $50
- 23.6%: $150 - ($50 × 0.236) = $138.20
- 38.2%: $150 - ($50 × 0.382) = $130.90
- 50%: $150 - ($50 × 0.50) = $125.00
- 61.8%: $150 - ($50 × 0.618) = $119.10
- 78.6%: $150 - ($50 × 0.786) = $110.70

### Question 5.2
Which Fibonacci retracement level is most important, and why?

**Answer:** 61.8% (the "golden" level). This is where most pullbacks stop in a healthy trend. It's the most reliable Fibonacci level, and professional traders place orders there.

### Question 5.3
Price approaches the 38.2% Fibonacci level from above (pulling back). What does this level represent?

**Answer:** Support level. Buyers are likely to step in here, causing a bounce. This is a good entry point for a long position, especially if the overall trend is bullish and a reversal candlestick forms.

### Question 5.4
You calculate a 61.8% retracement level and notice that the 50-day EMA is at the SAME price. What does this mean?

**Answer:** Confluence/alignment of multiple support levels. This is a STRONG support level. High probability that price will bounce here. Excellent place to enter a long trade with high confidence.

## Section 6: Chart Patterns (Lesson 6.6)

### Question 6.1
Describe what a flag looks like and how to trade it.

**Answer:** A flag has two parts: (1) Flagpole - a strong directional move, (2) Flag - a rectangular consolidation after the move. Trade it by:
1. Measure flagpole height
2. Wait for breakout above/below flag resistance/support
3. Target = Flagpole height added to breakout point
4. Stop loss on opposite side of flag

### Question 6.2
What's the difference between a flag and a pennant?

**Answer:** Both are consolidation patterns, but:
- **Flag**: Larger, takes 5-20 days, rectangular shape
- **Pennant**: Smaller, takes 3-10 days, triangle shape (converging)
Both have same principle: consolidation before breakout

### Question 6.3
A stock forms an ascending triangle (lower line rising up, upper line flat). Which direction will it break?

**Answer:** UP (bullish bias). Ascending triangles are bullish because the rising support line shows buyers are getting stronger. Most likely to break upward above the flat resistance line.

### Question 6.4
You identify a pennant pattern, but volume during the consolidation is very low. The breakout also occurs on low volume. Should you trade it?

**Answer:** NO. Volume is critical for confirming patterns. Low volume during consolidation could mean it's not a real pattern. Low volume on breakout means it might fail. Wait for volume to increase before trading.

## Section 7: Multiple Timeframe Analysis (Lesson 6.7)

### Question 7.1
You're analyzing a stock with these conditions:
- Weekly: Uptrend, price > 50-week MA
- Daily: Pullback, price near 20-day EMA
- Hourly: Bouncing from hourly support

What's your trading action?

**Answer:** BUY with high confidence. All timeframes are aligned in your favor:
- Weekly trend (boss) = UP
- Daily pullback = Normal in uptrends, good entry opportunity
- Hourly bounce = Exact entry trigger
This is a perfect multi-timeframe setup.

### Question 7.2
Weekly is in uptrend, but daily just turned down, and hourly is breaking below support. What's the warning?

**Answer:** Potential major reversal coming. Daily turning down is the first sign that the weekly uptrend might be ending. This is a divergence between timeframes. Reduce position size, raise stops, or prepare to exit. Higher timeframe reversal is likely coming soon.

### Question 7.3
Which timeframe should be used as the primary trend? Which for entry setup? Which for entry timing?

**Answer:**
- **Primary Trend**: Highest timeframe (weekly) - determines direction
- **Entry Setup**: Middle timeframe (daily) - shows pullbacks and reversals
- **Entry Timing**: Lowest timeframe (hourly) - provides exact entry point

### Question 7.4
You're a day trader. What three timeframes should you use?

**Answer:**
- **Hourly chart**: Primary (where you look for entries)
- **4-hour chart**: Confirms daily trend/setup
- **Daily chart**: Ensures you're trading with the main trend

Or alternatively: Hourly, 15-minute, and 5-minute (depending on how quick you trade)

## Quick Reference Tables

### Moving Average Settings by Timeframe

| Timeframe | Short-term | Medium-term | Long-term |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hourly | 5-period | 20-period | 50-period |
| 4-hour | 5-period | 20-period | 50-period |
| Daily | 20-period | 50-period | 200-period |

| 38.2% | Common first bounce |
| 50% | Psychological midpoint |
| 61.8% | Most important (golden level) |
| 78.6% | Deep pullback, near bottom |

### Chart Pattern Target Calculation

```
Pattern Height = Size of move BEFORE the pattern forms

FLAG:          Target = Breakout point + Flagpole height
PENNANT:       Target = Breakout point + Previous move height
TRIANGLE:      Target = Breakout point + Triangle base height
```

### Multi-Timeframe Quick Guide

```
Weekly UP + Daily UP + Hourly UP = STRONG BUY
Weekly UP + Daily UP + Hourly DOWN = Buy the dip
Weekly UP + Daily DOWN + Hourly DOWN = Caution
Weekly DOWN + Daily DOWN + Hourly DOWN = STRONG SELL
Weekly DOWN + Daily DOWN + Hourly UP = Short the bounce
Weekly DOWN + Daily UP + Hourly UP = Caution
```
