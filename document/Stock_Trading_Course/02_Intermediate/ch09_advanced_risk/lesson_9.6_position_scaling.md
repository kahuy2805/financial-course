# Lesson 9.6: Position Scaling (Pyramiding and Averaging)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand position scaling techniques (pyramiding and averaging)
- Apply scale-in strategies safely with position sizing
- Avoid averaging down into losses
- Manage scaled positions effectively

## What is Position Scaling?

Position scaling is building into a position over time, adding more shares as price changes or targets are reached.

### Key Types

```
Pyramiding (scaling up):
- Add to WINNING positions
- Each add is smaller than previous
- Lock in some profit, keep upside exposure
- Example: Buy 100 shares, add 50 on dip, add 25 on breakout

Averaging (scaling in):
- Build position before price confirmation
- Add at predefined levels during setup
- Average cost down (but carefully!)
- Example: Buy 50 shares, buy 50 more on dip, buy 50 more on bounce

Averaging down (dangerous):
- Add to LOSING positions
- Trying to lower average cost
- Often increases losses
- AVOID THIS - Causes ruin
- Example: Buy 100 at $100, drops to $90, buy 100 more at $90

Different goals:
- Pyramiding: Lock profit on winners, stay exposed
- Averaging: Build better cost basis before move
- Averaging down: Psychology (wrong thinking)
```

## Pyramiding Strategy

### Concept: Scaling Up Winning Positions

```
Position: Long MSFT at $350 (100 shares = $35,000)
Profit target: $380 (+8.6%)
Hold time: 5-10 days

Pyramid approach:
- Initial move: Price rallies to $360
- First pyramid: Add 50 shares (smaller than first 100)
- Move: Price rallies to $370
- Second pyramid: Add 25 shares (smaller than previous 50)
- Total position: 175 shares
- Average cost: Blended between $350, $360, $370

Calculation:
- Original: 100 × $350 = $35,000
- Pyramid 1: 50 × $360 = $18,000
- Pyramid 2: 25 × $370 = $9,250
- Total: 175 shares for $62,250
- Average cost: $62,250 / 175 = $355.71

Exit plan at $380:
- 175 shares × $380 = $66,500
- Profit: $66,500 - $62,250 = $4,250
- Return: 6.8% on capital deployed
- Would have been: 100 × ($380-$350) = $3,000 without pyramids
- Pyramid benefit: Additional $1,250 profit

Benefits:
- Profit from every stage of move
- Average cost lower than initial entry
- More shares working when price highest
- Each pyramid smaller = Reducing risk

Danger:
- If trend reverses at $370, extra shares lose money
- 175 shares × $10 stop hit = $1,750 loss vs. $1,000 on original
- Increased leverage increases drawdown
```

### Pyramid Strategy: Different Market Conditions

**Bullish market pyramiding:**

```
Setup: Stock breaking out, strong momentum
Entry: $100 (50 shares = $5,000)
RSI: 62 (strong but not extreme)
MACD: Positive, histogram expanding
Plan: Buy more on strength, not weakness

Development:
Day 1: Entry $100, price $100.50 EOD
- Position: 50 shares
- Observation: Breakout holding

Day 2: Open $101.50, buy +25 shares
- Pyramid 1: 25 × $101.50 = $2,537.50
- Total: 75 shares, avg cost = $100.83
- Reason: Clear follow-through, momentum confirmed

Day 3: Open $103, buy +12 shares
- Pyramid 2: 12 × $103 = $1,236
- Total: 87 shares, avg cost = $100.96
- Reason: Continued strength but slowing adds

Day 4: Price $105, take profits
- Sell 29 shares at $105 (original 50 - 50% = 25, add pyramid 1)
- Profit: 29 × ($105 - $100.83) = $122
- Remaining: 58 shares (pyramids 2 + remaining original)

Outcome: Scaled in on strength, took profits, let remainder run

Key principle: Pyramid on STRENGTH (price rising)
- Adds happen on up days
- Each add gets smaller
- When trend stops, stop adding
```

**Corrective market pyramiding:**

```
Setup: Pullback in established uptrend
Trend: Price above 50-day MA, higher lows
Entry: Buy after pullback
Plan: Scale in on dips and bounces

Development:
Entry 1: Price drops to $95 (5% pullback)
- Buy 40 shares at $95
- Reason: Support holding, buying dip

Entry 2: Price drops to $92 (7% pullback)
- Buy 30 shares at $92
- Total: 70 shares, avg cost = $93.57
- Reason: Strong support, lower adds

Entry 3: Price bounces to $95 (confirmation)
- Buy 20 shares at $95
- Total: 90 shares, avg cost = $93.89
- Reason: Support confirms, bounce confirms reversal

Exit: Price rallies to $110
- Sell all 90 shares at $110
- Profit: 90 × ($110 - $93.89) = $1,449.90 (15.4%)
- Benefit: Larger position on recovery trade

Key principle: Pyramid on SUPPORT (dips and bounces)
- Adds happen on down days in uptrend
- Build position as price recovers
- Each add smaller than previous
- Reduces average cost substantially
```

### Pyramid Position Sizing Rules

```
Original position: 50 shares (100%)
Risk: 1.5% of account = $300

Pyramid 1: 25 shares (50% of original)
- Risk: 1.5% of account = $300
- Total risk so far: $600 (3% of account)

Pyramid 2: 12 shares (25% of original)
- Risk: 1.5% of account = $300
- Total risk so far: $900 (4.5% of account)

Pyramid 3: 6 shares (12% of original)
- Risk: $300
- Total risk so far: $1,200 (6% of account)

Pattern: Each pyramid is 50% of previous

Total position: 50 + 25 + 12 + 6 = 93 shares
Total capital invested: Depends on prices at each add
Total risk: $1,200 (6% of $20K account)

Control method:
- Each add is fixed risk ($300)
- Shares purchased = Risk / Stop distance
- Prevents over-leverage
- Maintains discipline

Stop loss management:
- Original stop: $340 for first 50
- Add pyramids only if stop still valid
- If one stop hit: Total loss limited
- Exit all if main trend reverses
```

## Averaging Strategy (Building Positions)

### Concept: Strategic Entry Averaging

```
Setup: High-conviction swing trade identified
Price action: Consolidation, waiting for breakout
Plan: Build position before move, not after

Entry plan:
Buy 1: At support ($100)
Buy 2: At mid-consolidation ($105)
Buy 3: On breakout ($110)

Execution:

Entry 1: Stock at support $99.50
- Buy 40 shares at $99.50 (cost: $3,980)
- Reason: Logical support, start building

Wait: Stock consolidates $100-$105, 3 days

Entry 2: Stock at $105 (mid-range)
- Buy 30 shares at $105 (cost: $3,150)
- Total: 70 shares at avg $101.86
- Reason: Confirming consolidation support

Wait: Stock continues consolidating

Entry 3: Stock breaks above $110 (breakout)
- Buy 20 shares at $110.50 (cost: $2,210)
- Total: 90 shares at avg $103.56
- Reason: Breakout confirmation, final add

Target: $125

Result at target:
- 90 shares × $125 = $11,250
- Cost basis: $9,340
- Profit: $1,910 (20.4% gain)
- Benefit: More shares working when confirmation comes

vs. Single entry:
- Buy 90 at $110 (breakout only)
- Cost: $9,900
- Profit at $125: $1,350
- Difference: Saved $560 by averaging earlier
```

### Averaging Rules (Safety First)

```
DO:
✓ Average into UPTRENDS (price rising)
✓ Average at SUPPORT levels (technical confirmation)
✓ Average with DECLINING position size (smaller adds)
✓ Average with DECLINING risk per add ($300 max each)
✓ Average when THESIS unchanged (conviction high)
✓ Average with PROPER STOPS (protect each add)

DON'T:
✗ Average into DOWNTRENDS (losing trades)
✗ Average below moving averages (breaking trend)
✗ Average with EQUAL position sizes (increases leverage)
✗ Average without stops (reckless)
✗ Average when THESIS BROKEN (revenge trading)
✗ Average after hitting stop loss (averaging down!)

Example: Correct averaging in uptrend
- Uptrend: $90 → $100 → $110
- Support: $105 (pullback to support in uptrend)
- Add: Buy more at $105 support
- Risk: Limited (support holding, trend intact)

Example: Incorrect averaging in downtrend
- Downtrend: $110 → $100 → $90
- "Support": $95 (claimed support, but broken)
- Add: Buy more at $95 (averaging down!)
- Risk: UNLIMITED (trend broken, no support)
```

## What NOT to Do: Averaging Down

### Dangerous Strategy: Averaging Down Into Losses

```
The psychology:
- Buy AAPL at $100 (feels good)
- Price drops to $90 (feels bad)
- Think: "If I buy at $90, my average is $95" (feels better)
- Buy more shares at $90
- Price drops to $80 (feels terrible)
- Think: "If I buy at $80, average is $83.33" (feels better temporarily)
- Keep averaging down through $70, $60, $50

The math:
- 100 shares at $100 = $10,000
- 100 shares at $90 = $9,000 (total $19,000 = 200 shares)
- 100 shares at $80 = $8,000 (total $27,000 = 300 shares)
- Average cost: $27,000 / 300 = $90

The problem:
- Average cost looks better ($90 vs. $100)
- But position risk MULTIPLIED (300 shares vs. 100)
- Capital deployed TRIPLED ($27,000 vs. $10,000)
- If stock continues to $50: Loss = -$12,000 (63% of $19,000!)

Example of ruin:
- Original: 100 shares at $100, stop $80 = -$2,000 max loss
- Averaged down: 300 shares by $80, loss = -$9,000 (MUCH WORSE!)
- What was meant to be 2% loss became 47% loss!

The addiction:
- Lower average cost creates false hope
- Temporary relief from paper loss
- Each drop creates urge to average
- Eventually: Catastrophic loss that wipes account

The math trap:
- Psychologically: "Average cost is better"
- Financially: "Total loss is MUCH worse"
- Never average into losing position!
```

### Why Averaging Down Fails

```
Reason 1: Thesis was wrong
- You were wrong on entry
- Stock keeps dropping
- Averaging down = Doubling down on wrong thesis
- Result: Catastrophic loss

Reason 2: Trend has reversed
- Stock was in uptrend at $100
- Now in downtrend, moving to $70
- Averaging assumes trend will reverse
- Trend rarely reverses at averaging points
- Result: False bottom, continue lower

Reason 3: Exponential loss acceleration
- Loss at $100: 0%
- Loss at $90: 10%
- Loss at $80: 20%
- Loss at $70: 30%
- Loss at $60: 40%
- Each level down = Larger % loss
- If you average at EACH level, position grows
- Total loss: -50% to -70% (RUIN!)

Reason 4: Capital exhaustion
- Can't average down forever
- Account capital limited
- Eventually no capital to average
- Forced to exit at WORST price
- Result: Largest loss possible

Rule: ACCEPT LOSSES
- Stop loss at $80 (2% loss)
- Exit there, move on
- Capital preserved for next trade
- Much better than averaging down to -50% loss
```

## Scaling Position Management

### Managing Multiple Entries

**Tracking different cost bases:**

```
Position: 3-entry pyramid strategy
- Entry 1: 50 shares at $100 (first)
- Entry 2: 30 shares at $105 (add)
- Entry 3: 15 shares at $110 (final)

Total: 95 shares

Average cost calculation:
- (50 × $100) + (30 × $105) + (15 × $110) = $9,500 + $3,150 + $1,650 = $14,300
- Average: $14,300 / 95 = $150.53

Tracking in spreadsheet:
| Entry | Shares | Price | Cost   | Date |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| 1     | 50     | 100   | 5,000  | Jan1 |
| 2     | 30     | 105   | 3,150  | Jan3 |
| 3     | 15     | 110   | 1,650  | Jan5 |
| Total | 95     | 150.5 | 9,800  |      |

Exit plan:
- Option 1: Exit all at once at target
  - 95 × $120 = $11,400
  - Profit: $11,400 - $9,800 = $1,600

- Option 2: Exit in stages
  - Exit 1: 30 shares at $115 = $3,450 (profit: $900)
  - Exit 2: 35 shares at $120 = $4,200 (profit: $1,400)
  - Exit 3: 30 shares at $125 = $3,750 (profit: $2,250)
  - Total: Profit $4,550 (split across exits)
```

### Stop Loss Management for Scaled Positions

```
3-entry position with different stops:

Entry 1 (50 shares @ $100):
- Stop loss: $95 (original $500 stop)

Entry 2 (30 shares @ $105):
- Stop loss: $98 (new entry support)

Entry 3 (15 shares @ $110):
- Stop loss: $105 (breakout support)

Position stop:
- How to set stops for 95 share total?
- Option 1: Multiple orders
  - 50 share stop at $95
  - 30 share stop at $98
  - 15 share stop at $105
  - Confusing, creates slippage

- Option 2: Single unified stop
  - Use average cost: $150.53 (wait, that's wrong number)
  - Use lowest support from any entry: $95
  - Stop all 95 shares at $95
  - Single order, clean execution

Better approach:
- If price breaks support, entire position fails thesis
- Exit all at once at lowest confirmed support
- Don't try to manage multiple exits on same position
- Simpler, cleaner, less emotional
```

## Real Scaling Example: Multi-Day Build

### Case Study: Building MSFT Position Over 1 Week

```
Setup: MSFT showing consolidation pattern
- Support: $330
- Resistance: $345
- Range: 4.5% (good setup)
- Plan: Build 3-entry position over week

Entry 1 (Monday):
- Market: $335 (neutral)
- Decision: Buy half position at support
- Buy: 35 shares at $334.50
- Cost: $11,707.50
- Plan: Build from here

Entry 2 (Wednesday):
- Market: $331 (pullback)
- Support confirmed: Hold at $331
- Decision: Add to position
- Buy: 25 shares at $331.00
- Total: 60 shares, avg $332.92
- Cost: $19,975

Entry 3 (Friday):
- Market: $340 (bouncing)
- Breakout: Above $340 resistance
- Decision: Final add on breakout
- Buy: 15 shares at $340.50
- Total: 75 shares, avg $334.78
- Cost: $25,108.50

Target: $355 (+5.9%)

Monday next week (Exit):
- Price reaches $355
- Sell all 75 shares at $355
- Proceeds: $26,625
- Profit: $26,625 - $25,108.50 = $1,516.50
- Return: 6.0% on capital

Comparison:
- Single entry at $340 (Friday only): 75 × ($355-$340) = $1,125 profit
- Pyramid strategy: $1,516.50 profit
- Benefit: $391.50 additional profit (35% more!)

Key learning:
- Averaged price down to $334.78 (vs. $340 single entry)
- Better cost basis = Better profit when exiting
- Built position on strength and weakness
- Multiple entries = Lower risk per entry
- Result: Higher profit on same target price
```

## Summary

Position scaling (pyramiding) adds to winning positions:
- Pyramid up: Add smaller amounts as price rises
- Average in: Build position at support levels
- Each addition: Smaller than previous
- Risk management: Fixed risk per add ($300)
- Avoid: Averaging down into losses

Key principle: Scale into winners, not losers.

## Key Takeaways

1. Pyramiding: Add to WINNERS (prices rising)
2. Averaging: Build at SUPPORT levels (planned)
3. Each pyramid: Smaller than previous (declining risk)
4. Fixed risk: $300 max per add (discipline)
5. Never average down: Losing positions forbidden
6. Track average cost: Important for position management
7. Unified stops: Better than multiple stop orders
8. Scale exits: Sell in stages, lock profits
9. Maximum pyramids: Usually 3-4 (diminishing returns)
10. Psychology: Feel the urge to average down? EXIT instead

## Next Steps

- Build position averaging plan for next setup
- Calculate pyramid sizes for different capital amounts
- Practice tracking average cost with spreadsheet
- Set up unified stop loss for scaled positions
- Review past trades for pyramid opportunities
