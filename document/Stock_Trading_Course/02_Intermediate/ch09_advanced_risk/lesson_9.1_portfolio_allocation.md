# Lesson 9.1: Portfolio Allocation Strategies

## Learning Objectives
- Understand risk-based portfolio construction
- Apply sector and position diversification
- Balance growth and stability in allocation
- Manage drawdowns through proper allocation

## What is Portfolio Allocation?

Portfolio allocation is the strategic distribution of capital across different positions, sectors, and asset types to manage risk while pursuing returns.

### Key Concepts

```
Allocation Decision Framework:
1. Total capital available
2. Risk tolerance (percentage drawdown acceptable)
3. Number of positions (diversification)
4. Sector allocation (concentration risk)
5. Position size per trade
6. Cash reserves (for opportunities/emergency)

Example:
$25,000 portfolio
├─ 40% in active trading ($10,000)
├─ 30% in swing positions ($7,500)
├─ 20% in position trades ($5,000)
└─ 10% cash reserve ($2,500)
```

## Position-Based Allocation

### Fixed Position Sizing

**Method 1: Equal Weight Allocation**

```
All positions equal size:

$20,000 portfolio with 4 positions
- Position size: $20,000 / 4 = $5,000 each
- Pros: Simple, equal risk exposure
- Cons: Ignores stop loss distance, position risk varies

$5,000 Position 1: Entry $100, Stop $95 (-$250, 5%)
$5,000 Position 2: Entry $50, Stop $48 (-$200, 4%)
$5,000 Position 3: Entry $200, Stop $190 (-$500, 10%)
$5,000 Position 4: Entry $75, Stop $72 (-$225, 4.5%)

Total risk: $1,175 (5.875% of account)
Problem: Position 3 has too much risk!
```

### Risk-Based Position Sizing (Preferred)

**Method 2: Fixed Risk Per Position**

```
Decision: Maximum 1.5% risk per position
Account: $20,000 = $300 risk per position

Position 1 (AAPL):
- Entry: $180.00
- Stop Loss: $175.00 (distance = $5)
- Position size: $300 / $5 = 60 shares
- Capital: $10,800 (54% of account)

Position 2 (NVDA):
- Entry: $850.00
- Stop Loss: $830.00 (distance = $20)
- Position size: $300 / $20 = 15 shares
- Capital: $12,750 (64% of account)

Problem: Both positions exceed full account capital!
Solution: Use alternate allocations or reduce simultaneous positions
```

### Percentage Position Sizing

**Better method for multiple positions:**

```
Allocation strategy:
- Max 4 simultaneous positions
- Position 1: 35% of capital
- Position 2: 25% of capital
- Position 3: 20% of capital
- Position 4: 15% of capital
- Reserve: 5% cash

Example with $20,000:
- Position 1: $7,000 (highest conviction)
- Position 2: $5,000
- Position 3: $4,000
- Position 4: $3,000
- Cash: $1,000

Risk calculation for Position 1:
- Entry: $100.00
- Stop: $95.00 (-$5 per share)
- Shares: $7,000 / $100 = 70 shares
- Risk: 70 × $5 = $350 (1.75% account)
```

## Portfolio Diversification Strategies

### Sector Diversification

**Avoid concentration risk:**

```
Bad Allocation - All tech:
- AAPL (50%), MSFT (25%), NVDA (25%)
- Risk: Tech sector crash wipes out portfolio
- Sector risk: 100% tech exposure

Good Allocation - Balanced:
- Technology (35%): MSFT, AAPL
- Finance (25%): JPM, GS
- Healthcare (20%): JNJ, UNH
- Consumer (20%): TM, WMT
- Sector risk: Diversified, no crash wipes out all

Rationale:
- Different sectors move differently
- Sector rotation benefits diversification
- Market events impact sectors unequally
```

### Position Type Diversification

**Mix trading strategies:**

```
$25,000 Portfolio Mix:

Day Trading (Quick turnover):
- 2-3 positions
- Risk: 0.5-1% per trade
- Hold: Hours to 1 day
- Capital: 20% = $5,000

Swing Trading (3-10 day holds):
- 2-3 positions
- Risk: 1-1.5% per position
- Hold: 3-10 days
- Capital: 35% = $8,750

Position Trading (Weeks to months):
- 1-2 positions
- Risk: 2-3% per position
- Hold: 4-24 weeks
- Capital: 30% = $7,500

Cash Reserve:
- Emergency capital
- Opportunity capital
- Capital: 15% = $3,750

Benefits:
- Diversified time horizons
- Some positions always "working"
- Opportunity to add on dips
```

## Maximum Drawdown Allocation

### Determining Acceptable Drawdown

```
Conservative trader (sleep well):
- Acceptable drawdown: 10% maximum
- Rough allocation: Max 3 positions of 2-3% each
- Needs tight stops and lower risk tolerance

Moderate trader (normal psychology):
- Acceptable drawdown: 15-20%
- Rough allocation: Max 4-5 positions of 2-3% each
- Can handle normal market swings

Aggressive trader (high risk):
- Acceptable drawdown: 25-30%
- Rough allocation: Max 6+ positions of 2-3% each
- Must have strong psychological discipline

Formula:
Maximum positions = Acceptable drawdown / Risk per position

Example:
- Acceptable drawdown: 15%
- Risk per position: 2%
- Max positions: 15% / 2% = 7.5 (7-8 positions safe)
```

### Calculating Worst-Case Scenario

```
Portfolio: $25,000
4 Positions with $500 risk each

Position 1: AAPL, -$500 (stop hit)
Position 2: MSFT, -$500 (stop hit)
Position 3: NVDA, -$500 (stop hit)
Position 4: AMD, -$500 (stop hit)

Worst case: All 4 positions stop out simultaneously
Total loss: $2,000 (8% drawdown)

Risk Assessment:
- 8% loss is within acceptable range
- Portfolio continues operating
- Rebuild opportunity from $23,000 base
- This is manageable

Conservative Approach:
- Avoid having all positions in similar sectors
- Stagger entry points (don't add all at once)
- Monitor correlation (avoid 4 positions that move together)
```

## Core-Satellite Allocation

### Core Holdings + Satellite Positions

```
Core holdings (70% of capital):
- 1-2 largest positions
- Higher conviction setups
- Longer-term holds (swing to position trades)
- Example: $7,000 in position trade + $10,500 in swing trade

Satellite positions (30% of capital):
- 2-4 smaller positions
- Opportunistic setups
- Shorter-term holds (day to swing)
- Example: 4 positions of $1,875 each

Advantage:
- Most capital in high-quality trades
- Flexibility for smaller trades
- Risk concentrated in best ideas
- Satellite positions can take profits quickly

Example Portfolio Structure:
- Core Satellite 1 (MSFT position): $8,000 (35%)
- Core Satellite 2 (AAPL swing): $9,000 (40%)
- Satellite Position 1 (NVDA day trade): $2,000 (9%)
- Satellite Position 2 (AMD momentum): $1,500 (7%)
- Satellite Position 3 (XOM range): $2,000 (9%)
- Cash: $2,500 (11%)
```

## Rebalancing Strategy

### When to Rebalance

```
Scenario 1: Winning positions grow
- Initial: 4 positions of $5,000 each
- After week: Position 1 now worth $5,800 (+16%)
- Position 2 now worth $4,200 (-16%)
- Position 3 at $5,000 (flat)
- Position 4 at $5,000 (flat)

Rebalancing decision:
- Let winners run vs. take profits
- Recommended: Partial profit taking (1/3)
- Allows position to grow but locks in gains
- Action: Sell 1/3 of winning position

Scenario 2: Losing positions shrink
- Position value: $4,500 (down $500)
- Should you add? (AVERAGING DOWN)
- Recommendation: NO
- Rule: Never average down into losing position
- Keep original position size or exit entirely
```

### Quarterly Rebalancing Review

```
End of quarter review:

Check allocations:
- Are positions still sized correctly?
- Have sectors become concentrated?
- Is cash reserve adequate?
- Are any positions underwater >10%?

Adjust if needed:
- Exit underperforming sectors
- Rebuild cash if depleted
- Rebalance massive winners (partial exits)
- Add to core positions if thesis intact

Example:
Quarter start: 35% tech, 25% healthcare, 20% finance, 20% consumer
Quarter end: 55% tech (winners), 15% healthcare, 15% finance, 15% consumer

Action: Rebalance to target allocation
- Sell 1/3 of tech winners
- Add to healthcare, finance, consumer
- Return to balanced 30-35% tech target
```

## Leverage in Portfolio Allocation

### Margin Usage Risks

```
Without margin (safe):
- $25,000 account
- Max positions: $25,000
- Leverage: 1:1
- Risk: Can lose full account but not more

With 2:1 margin (moderate risk):
- $25,000 account + $25,000 margin = $50,000 buying power
- Max positions: $50,000
- Leverage: 2:1
- Risk: Can lose more than full account!

Example loss scenario with margin:
- Account: $25,000
- Margin borrowed: $25,000
- Total position: $50,000
- Large loss: -$30,000 (60% move against position)
- Account after loss: -$5,000 (NEGATIVE!)
- Broker forces liquidation
- Result: Debt to broker

Recommendation for intermediate traders:
- Avoid margin for portfolio allocation
- Use 1:1 leverage only
- Build capital through profits, not borrowed money
```

## Real Portfolio Examples

### Example 1: $15,000 Conservative Portfolio

```
Risk tolerance: 10% maximum drawdown
Acceptable loss: $1,500

Allocation:
- Position Trade 1 (MSFT): $4,000
  Stop: $340, Price: $350
  Share calc: $4,000 / $350 = 11 shares
  Risk: 11 × $10 = $110 (0.73%)

- Swing Trade 1 (AAPL): $3,500
  Stop: $170, Price: $180
  Shares: 19 shares
  Risk: 19 × $10 = $190 (1.27%)

- Swing Trade 2 (AMD): $2,500
  Stop: $100, Price: $105
  Shares: 23 shares
  Risk: 23 × $5 = $115 (0.77%)

- Day Trades (cash): $3,500
  Average risk per day trade: 0.75%
  Max daily risk: $112

- Cash reserve: $1,500 (emergency/opportunity)

Total portfolio risk: 3.5% across all positions
Maximum drawdown if all stop out: $525 (3.5%)
Acceptable within 10% limit

Diversification:
- Sector: Tech + Semiconductor (correlated risk)
- Better: Add finance or healthcare position
```

### Example 2: $25,000 Moderate Portfolio

```
Risk tolerance: 15-20% maximum drawdown

Allocation:
- Position Trade (NVDA): $8,000 (40%)
  Risk: 2% = $500
  Stop distance: $25, Shares: 20

- Swing Trade 1 (AAPL): $5,000 (20%)
  Risk: 1.5% = $375
  Stop distance: $5, Shares: 75

- Swing Trade 2 (MSFT): $4,000 (16%)
  Risk: 1.5% = $375
  Stop distance: $10, Shares: 40

- Day Trades / Satellites (4 positions): $6,000 (24%)
  Risk per trade: 0.75% = $187.50
  Allows up to 4 smaller positions

- Cash reserve: $2,000 (8%)

Total risk: 7.5% across main positions + day trade risks
Worst case: 10-12% drawdown (within 15-20% tolerance)

Diversification:
- Sector: Tech (50%), Semiconductors (20%), Finance (15%), Discretionary (15%)
- Strategy: Position + Swing + Day (time diversification)
- Good balance of growth and stability
```

### Example 3: $20,000 Aggressive Portfolio

```
Risk tolerance: 20-30% maximum drawdown

Allocation (6 simultaneous positions):
- Position Trade 1: $5,000 (25%)
- Position Trade 2: $4,000 (20%)
- Swing Trade 1: $3,500 (17.5%)
- Swing Trade 2: $2,500 (12.5%)
- Day Trade 1: $2,000 (10%)
- Day Trade 2: $2,000 (10%)
- Cash: $1,500 (7.5%)

Risk per position:
- Position trades: 2% risk = $400 each
- Swing trades: 1.5% risk = $300 each
- Day trades: 1% risk = $200 each

Total position risk: $1,700 (8.5%)

This allows:
- 4-6 positions simultaneously
- Multiple concurrent trades
- Higher turnover and opportunity
- But requires active management
- And discipline on stops

Only suitable if:
- You have 1-2 hours daily for monitoring
- You can execute trades quickly
- You have strong stop-loss discipline
- You've paper traded this successfully first
```

## Portfolio Allocation Checklist

### Before Taking New Position

```
☐ Total capital currently deployed: $_____
☐ Cash reserve remaining: $_____
☐ New position risk: $_____
☐ Total portfolio risk (all positions): $_____
☐ Risk as % of account: ____% (must be under max)

- Reduce sector concentration if >40%?
- Add position if all stops are firm?
```

## Summary

Portfolio allocation is the foundation of risk management:
- Fixed capital per position limits risk
- Sector diversification reduces correlation risk
- Multiple strategies provide balanced returns
- Maximum drawdown tolerance guides position limits
- Regular rebalancing maintains allocation targets

Key principle: Allocation should match your psychology and time commitment.
