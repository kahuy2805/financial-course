# Lesson 8.7: Range Trading (Sideways Markets)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify range-bound trading environments
- Trade support and resistance within ranges
- Use range trading in sideways markets
- Apply proper position sizing for range trading

## What is Range Trading?

Range trading captures price movement within defined support and resistance levels in sideways (non-trending) markets.

### Key Characteristics
- **Definition**: Trading within established support and resistance levels
- **Market Type**: Sideways consolidation (no clear trend)
- **Strategy**: Buy at support, sell at resistance repeatedly
- **Duration**: 2-7 days per trade
- **Frequency**: Multiple trades per week possible
- **Risk Management**: Tight stop losses above/below range

## Market Conditions for Range Trading

### Identifying Range-Bound Markets

```
Range-Bound Characteristics:
- Price oscillating between two levels
- No clear directional trend (not higher highs or lower lows)
- Support level: Holds multiple times
- Resistance level: Rejects multiple times
- Volatility: Lower than trending markets
- Volume: Below average (indecision)

Example Visual:
    ▲ Resistance $110
    |
 ─────────────────  $105 average
    |
    ▼ Support $100

Observations:
- Price bounces off support ($100) 3 times
- Price rejected at resistance ($110) 2 times
- 3-week consolidation pattern
- Volume declining (indecision)
```

### Range Identification Checklist

```
Is this a range market?
☐ Price not making new highs (resistance firm)
☐ Price not making new lows (support firm)
☐ High-low distance 5% or less (narrow range)
☐ 3+ tests of support level
☐ 3+ rejections at resistance
☐ Duration: 2 weeks minimum
☐ Volume declining (typical of ranges)
☐ No major news/events within range
```

## Support and Resistance in Ranges

### Finding Range Levels

```
Method 1: Recent price history
- Identify recent high: $155.00
- Identify recent low: $145.00
- Range exists: $145-$155 (10-point range)
- Midpoint: $150.00

Method 2: Multiple touches
- Support: Level where price bounced 3+ times
- Resistance: Level where price rejected 3+ times
- Example:
  - Support $145 (bounced 3/5 attempts)
  - Resistance $155 (rejected 2/4 attempts)

Method 3: Technical levels
- Previous swing high = Resistance
- Previous swing low = Support
- Moving average (20-day or 50-day) = Mid-range
```

### Range Trading Setup

```
Established Range: $100 support, $110 resistance

Trade 1 - Support Bounce:
- Buy at support: $100.50
- Stop loss: $99.00 (below support)
- Target: $109.50 (near resistance)
- Risk: $1.50 per share
- Reward: $9.00 per share
- Risk-Reward: 1:6

Trade 2 - Resistance Fade:
- Sell/Short at resistance: $109.50
- Stop loss: $111.00 (above resistance)
- Target: $100.50 (near support)
- Risk: $1.50 per share
- Reward: $9.00 per share
- Risk-Reward: 1:6

Both trades have excellent risk-reward!
```

## Range Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Support Bounce Trade

**The Setup:**
```
Range identified: $100-$110 (10-point range)
Support level: $100 (tested 3 times recently)
Current price: $101.50 (pulling back)

Technical confirmation:
- RSI: 35 (oversold, bounce expected)
- MACD: Near crossover (about to turn up)
- Volume: Low (normal for range)

Entry Setup:
- Entry target: $100.50
- Position: 50 shares
- Stop loss: $98.00 (-$125)
- Target 1: $105.00 (+$225)
- Target 2: $108.50 (+$425)

Risk: $125 (0.625% on $20K)
Reward: $225-$425 (1.125%-2.125%)
Frequency: Trade this 2-3x per week
```

**Real-World Example:**

```
Stock: Bank of America (BAC)
Range: $32.50 - $34.50 (observed for 3 weeks)
Support: $32.50 (bounced 4 times)
Resistance: $34.50 (rejected 3 times)

Trade Setup:
- Stock dropping toward support
- Price: $32.60 (near support)
- RSI: 28 (oversold)
- Entry: $32.55 (at support)
- Position: 100 shares ($3,255)
- Stop: $31.50 (-$105)
- Target 1: $33.50 (+$95)
- Target 2: $34.25 (+$170)

Hold: 2-4 days in range
Frequency: This trade repeats 2-3× per week
```

### Strategy 2: Resistance Fade Trade (Short)

**The Setup:**
```
Range: $100-$110
Resistance: $110 (rejected twice recently)
Current: $108.50 (approaching resistance)

Technical confirmation:
- RSI: 65 (approaching overbought)
- Price rejected at $110 twice
- Volume declining into resistance (weak)

Short Entry:
- Entry target: $109.50
- Position: 40 shares short
- Stop loss: $111.50 (+$60)
- Target 1: $105.00 (+$180)
- Target 2: $102.50 (+$280)

Risk: $60 (0.3% on $20K)
Reward: $180-$280 (0.9%-1.4%)
Risk-Reward: 1:3 to 1:4.7
```

### Strategy 3: Midpoint Scalp Trade

**Quick profits from midpoint oscillation:**

```
Range: $100-$110 (10-point range)
Midpoint: $105

Setup:
- Price bounces between support ($100) and resistance ($110)
- Oscillates around midpoint ($105)
- Trade is near midpoint

Scalp Trade Entry 1:
- Price at midpoint $105
- Bouncing from support
- Entry: Buy $105.10
- Stop: $104.50 (-$30)
- Target: $107.50 (+$72)
- Hold: 1-2 days

Scalp Trade Entry 2:
- Price at midpoint $105
- Failing at resistance
- Entry: Short $104.90
- Stop: $105.50 (+$24)
- Target: $103.00 (+$57)
- Hold: 1-2 days

These can repeat 3-5× per week
```

## Range Trading with Position Sizing

### Conservative Approach (1% risk per trade)

```
Account: $20,000
Risk per trade: 1% = $200

Stock: XYZ in $50-$55 range

Trade 1 - Support bounce:
- Entry: $50.50
- Stop: $49.00 (-$1.50 per share)
- Position size: $200 / $1.50 = 133 shares
- Capital needed: 133 × $50.50 = $6,716

Risk management: Maximum 2 trades simultaneously
- Trade 1 ($200 risk) + Trade 2 ($200 risk) = $400 total risk
- Below daily risk limit (2-3% = $400-600)
```

### Aggressive Approach (Multiple simultaneous trades)

```
Account: $20,000
Daily risk budget: 2% = $400
Trades per day: Up to 4 range trades

Trade 1: $100 risk (0.5%)
Trade 2: $100 risk (0.5%)
Trade 3: $100 risk (0.5%)
Trade 4: $100 risk (0.5%)

Total: $400 risk (2% daily limit)

This works ONLY if:
- Each trade has defined stop loss
- Trades are in different stocks (diversified)
- All stops are respected (discipline)
- Daily P&L is tracked
```

## Range Trading Entry and Exit

### Precise Entry Execution

```
Entry at Support:
1. Price approaches support level
2. Wait for candlestick confirmation
   - Green candle bouncing from support
   - Volume increasing on bounce
3. Enter on close of confirmation candle
4. OR use limit order at support level

Example:
- Support: $100
- Price at $100.30 (approaching)
- Candle pattern: Hammer or bullish engulfing
- Entry: Limit order at $100.50
- Execute: Gets filled as bounce begins
```

### Exit Management in Ranges

```
Exit at Resistance:
1. Price approaches resistance level
2. Cancel any remaining buy orders
3. Monitor rejection patterns:
   - Shooting star (high wick, lower close)
   - Bearish engulfing
   - Volume spike at resistance
4. Exit near resistance, don't wait for perfect
5. Use limit order to sell at target

Partial Exits:
- 50% position at first target (1:1 risk-reward)
- 50% position at resistance (approaching 1:1.5)
- Gives flexibility if resistance breaks

Stop Loss Discipline:
- Market order at stop loss level
- NO exceptions
- Range WILL break eventually
- Protect capital
```

## Range Duration and Breakout Warning

### How Long Do Ranges Last?

```
Typical Range Durations:
- Short ranges: 2-4 weeks (usually break)
- Medium ranges: 4-8 weeks (extended consolidation)
- Long ranges: 8+ weeks (major reversal often)

General Rule:
- Most ranges break within 4-6 weeks
- If range persists 8+ weeks, reversal likely
- Be aware of time limit for range trades

Fade ranges lasting 3+ months:
- Probability of breakout increases
- Reduce position size
- Tighter stops
- Prepare for range break scenario
```

### Signs of Range Breakout Coming

```
Decreasing volume:
- Volume declining into range
- Lack of buying/selling pressure
- Breakout coming (but which direction?)
- Reduce position size

Increasing volatility:
- Range widening (high-low distance increasing)
- More extreme reversals within range
- Pressure building for breakout
- Reduce position size or exit

Price penetrating levels:
- Support broken (even slightly)
- OR resistance broken
- Could be false breakout, but increase caution
- Exit range positions immediately

Catalyst events:
- Earnings announcement approaching
- Major economic data
- News release imminent
- Reduce/exit range trades pre-event
```

## Range Trading with Technical Indicators

### RSI in Ranges

```
RSI interpretation in ranges:
- RSI > 70: Overbought, sell/short signal
- RSI < 30: Oversold, buy signal
- RSI 40-60: Range middle, neutral
- RSI extreme: Exit signal

Example:
Range: $100-$110
- Price at $100.50 (support)
- RSI: 25 (oversold)
- BUY setup confirmed
- Entry: $100.50, Target: $109.00

- Price at $108.00 (near resistance)
- RSI: 72 (overbought)
- EXIT or SHORT setup
- Sell/cover at $109.00
```

### Bollinger Bands in Ranges

```
Bollinger Bands setup for range trading:
- Upper band: Resistance
- Lower band: Support
- Moving average: Range midpoint

Trade Setup:
- Price touches lower band = BUY
- Price touches upper band = SELL/SHORT
- Price near middle band = Wait/Exit

Tight bands = Narrow range (good for trading)
Wide bands = Wide range (less frequent trades)
Band squeeze = Breakout coming (exit positions)
```

## Range Trading Risk Management

### Daily/Weekly Checklist

```
Each Range Trade Checklist:
☐ Range confirmed (3+ tests each level)
☐ Entry at support or resistance level
☐ Stop loss placed at logical level
☐ Risk per trade 0.5-1%
☐ Target at opposite range level
☐ Sufficient capital for position
☐ Time to monitor position

During Week:
☐ Track win/loss ratio
☐ Monitor for range break signs
☐ Reduce size if range persists 6+ weeks
☐ Exit if support/resistance breaks
☐ Reassess range validity

Exit Range Trades When:
☐ Range breaks (breakout fails = range break)
☐ Time exceeds 8 weeks (reversal likely)
☐ Volume dries up (end of consolidation)
☐ Daily loss limit hit
☐ Better opportunity elsewhere
```

### Common Range Trading Mistakes

1. **Unclear support/resistance**
   - Problem: Picking arbitrary levels
   - Result: Stop losses hit on noise
   - Solution: Require 3+ tests of level

2. **Trading range before range established**
   - Problem: Entering trending market thinking it's range
   - Result: Position stops out on trend continuation
   - Solution: Wait for 2 weeks consolidation minimum

3. **Over-trading the range**
   - Problem: Trading every bounce
   - Result: Accumulating losses on similar risk trades
   - Solution: Maximum 3-4 range trades per week

4. **Ignoring breakout signs**
   - Problem: Continuing range trades as breakout develops
   - Result: Large loss when range finally breaks
   - Solution: Exit range trades on volume increase/volatility

5. **Holding through range break**
   - Problem: Stop loss too far away
   - Result: Catastrophic loss when support/resistance fails
   - Solution: Tight stops at range levels
