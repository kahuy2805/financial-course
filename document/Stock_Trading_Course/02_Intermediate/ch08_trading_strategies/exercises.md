# Chapter 8 Exercises: Trading Strategies

## Exercise 8.1: Day Trading Opening Range Breakout

### Objective
Practice identifying and trading opening range breakouts using proper position sizing.

### Scenario
You have a $20,000 trading account. It's 9:30 AM EST.

**Stock:** Tesla (TSLA)
**First 30 minutes (9:30-10:00 AM):**
- High: $875.50
- Low: $872.00
- Range: $3.50

**Current price at 10:05 AM:** $875.80

### Tasks

1. **Identify the breakout setup:**
   - What is the opening range?
   - What is the breakout level?
   - What would be the pullback/retest level?

2. **Determine position sizing:**
   - Set stop loss at: (below range low)
   - Stop loss distance in dollars:
   - Target risk: 0.5% of account = $100
   - Position size in shares: (Risk / Stop distance)
   - Total capital needed:

3. **Set targets:**
   - Target 1 (1:1 risk-reward):
   - Target 2 (2:1 risk-reward):

4. **Create trade plan:**
   - When would you enter?
   - When would you take Target 1 profit?
   - When would you hold for Target 2?
   - What is your daily loss limit?

### Expected Answer Example
```
Opening Range: $872.00 - $875.50
Breakout level: $875.60
Stop loss: $871.50 (-$4.10 per share)
Position size: $100 / $4.10 = 24 shares
Capital needed: 24 × $875.80 = $21,019 (exceeds account!)

Adjusted position: 22 shares ($19,268)
Actual risk: $90.20 (0.45%)
Target 1: $875.60 + $4.10 = $879.70
Target 2: $875.60 + $8.20 = $883.80
```

   - AMD: Stop distance = $5 | Risk limit = 1.5% ($225) | Shares:
   - NVDA: Stop distance = $20 | Risk limit = 1.5% ($225) | Shares:

2. **Calculate capital allocation:**
   - Position 1 (MSFT): Shares × Entry price =
   - Position 2 (AAPL): Shares × Entry price =
   - Position 3 (AMD): Shares × Entry price =
   - Position 4 (NVDA): Shares × Entry price =
   - Total capital used:
   - Cash remaining:

3. **Verify portfolio risk:**
   - Total risk across all positions: (sum all stop losses)
   - Risk percentage of account:
   - Is this acceptable (under 6-8%)?

4. **Create exit plan:**
   - When will you take 1/3 profit on each?
