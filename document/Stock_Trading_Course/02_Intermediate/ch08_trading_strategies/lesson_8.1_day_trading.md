Day trading involves opening and closing positions within the same trading day, typically using 1-minute to 60-minute charts.

### Key Characteristics
- **Holding Period**: Minutes to hours (not overnight)
- **Capital Requirement**: Minimum $25,000 USD (PDT Rule - Pattern Day Trader)
- **Trading Activity**: 4+ day trades per week triggers PDT classification
- **Typical Daily Goal**: 0.5%-2% portfolio gain
- **Risk per Trade**: 0.5%-1% of account

## Opening Hour Strategy (9:30 AM - 10:30 AM EST)

### Why the Opening Hour Matters
- Highest volatility and volume
- Gap opening from overnight news
- Institutional orders release
- New trend establishment

### Strategy: Opening Range Breakout (ORB)

**The Setup:**
1. Monitor first 30 minutes (9:30-10:00 AM)
2. Identify highest high and lowest low
3. Set breakout levels above/below range

**Example with $20K Portfolio:**

```
Portfolio: $20,000
Risk per trade: $100 (0.5%)
Position size: Based on stop loss distance

Stock: AAPL opening at 9:30 AM
- First 30 min High: $175.50
- First 30 min Low: $174.80
- Range: $0.70

LONG Setup:
- Entry: Breakout above $175.50
- Stop Loss: Below $174.80 (0.70 loss)
- Position Size: $100 / $0.70 = ~143 shares

Target 1: $176.20 (+0.70, Risk-Reward 1:1)
Target 2: $177.00 (+1.50, Risk-Reward 2.1:1)
```

**Trade Example:**
- Enter 143 shares at $175.51
- Stop loss triggered at $174.79 = -$100 loss
- OR reach Target 1 for +$100 profit (1:1 trade)
- OR reach Target 2 for +$214.50 profit (2.1:1 trade)

## Mid-Day Strategy (10:30 AM - 2:00 PM EST)

### Characteristics
- Consolidation periods common
- Lower volatility than opening
- Good for swing trades within day
- Lunch hour (11:30 AM-1 PM) has reduced volume

### Strategy: Support/Resistance Bounce

**The Setup:**
1. Identify major support and resistance levels
2. Wait for price to touch level
3. Enter on bounce with tight stop

**Example:**

```
Stock: TSLA at 11:45 AM
Identified Support: $240.00 (previous day low)
Recent Resistance: $242.50

Trade:
- Price drops to $240.05
- Enter long 50 shares at $240.15
- Stop Loss: $239.50 (-0.65 per share)
- Target: $242.00 (+1.85 per share)

Risk: 50 shares × $0.65 = $32.50
Reward: 50 shares × $1.85 = $92.50
Risk-Reward Ratio: 1:2.85
```

## Closing Hour Strategy (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM EST)

### Why the Closing Hour Matters
- Final positioning before overnight risk
- Reversal patterns common
- Last chance to trade news
- Volume spike in final minutes

### Strategy: Closing Range Fade

**The Setup:**
1. Identify strong move into close
2. Watch for rejection of extremes
3. Fade (trade against) the excessive move
4. Short or take profits on longs

**Example with $15K Position:**

```
MSFT trading scenario:
- Day high: $425.00
- Current time: 3:50 PM
- Price near high at $424.90
- Moving up aggressively

Concern: Extended move, exhaustion pattern forming

Fade Setup:
- Short 35 shares at $424.80
- Stop Loss: $425.50 (+0.70)
- Target: $423.50 (-1.30)

Risk: 35 × $0.70 = $24.50
Reward: 35 × $1.30 = $45.50
Risk-Reward: 1:1.86

Hold until close or target hit
```
