# Lesson 8.2: Swing Trading Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand multi-day position management (3-14 day holds)

## What is Swing Trading?

Swing trading captures 3-14 day price moves using daily and 4-hour timeframes. It balances the frequency of day trading with the holding periods of position trading.

### Key Characteristics
- **Holding Period**: 3-14 days typically
- **Trading Timeframe**: 4-hour and daily charts
- **Capital Requirement**: $5,000 minimum (no PDT rules apply)
- **Daily Time Commitment**: 30-60 minutes per day
- **Typical Gain per Trade**: 2%-8%
- **Risk per Trade**: 1%-2% of account

## Chart Analysis for Swing Trading

### Daily Chart Pattern Recognition

#### 1. Higher Lows with Higher Highs (Uptrend)
```
Visual Pattern:
    /
   / \
  /   \
 /     \
Price Action:

- Target: Previous resistance or higher high
```

#### 2. Lower Highs with Lower Lows (Downtrend)
```
Visual Pattern:
\
 \   /
  \ /
   \
Price Action:
- Each high is lower than previous high

```

#### 3. Consolidation Breakout
```
4-week consolidation range:
│  ▲─────────┐
│  │ Box     │
│  │ $50-$55 │
│  └─────────┘
     Breakout upward
Entry: Above $55.00 with volume
Stop: Below consolidation low $49.80
Target: Height of box projected up ($5) = $60.00
```

## Swing Trading Setup Examples

### Setup 1: Pullback to Moving Average

**The Strategy:**
- Stock in uptrend (price above 50-day MA)
- Price pulls back to 50-day MA
- Enter on bounce from MA
- Stop below MA and recent swing low

**Example with $15,000 Portfolio:**

```
Stock: MSFT
- 50-day MA: $350.00
- Recent Swing Low: $348.50
- Current Price: $345.00 (pullback)
- Support Confluence: 50-day MA + swing low

Entry Setup:
- Buy 35 shares at $350.10 (above MA)
- Stop Loss: $348.00 (-2.10 per share = -$73.50)
- Target 1: $358.00 (+8.00 per share)
- Target 2: $365.00 (+15.00 per share)

Risk: $73.50 (0.49%)
Position Size: 35 shares
Time Horizon: 5-10 days
```

### Setup 2: Double Bottom Reversal

**The Strategy:**
- Downtrend established
- Price tests support level twice
- Second test holds above first test
- Reversal expected on break above resistance

**Example with $20,000 Portfolio:**

```
Stock: AMD
- First Support Test: $95.00
- Second Support Test: $95.50 (held higher)
- Resistance (neckline): $102.00

Setup:
- Buy 150 shares at $102.50 (above resistance)
- Stop Loss: $94.80 (-7.70 per share = -$1,155)

Position Size Adjustment:
- Reduce risk to 1% = $200 max
- Position size: $200 / $7.70 = 26 shares

Risk: $200 (1%)
Reward Target: $110.00 (+7.50 = +$195)
Risk-Reward: 1:0.98 (Adjust targets)

BETTER Setup:
- Target: $115.00 (+12.50 = +$325)
- Risk-Reward: 1:1.63
- Hold: 7-12 days expected
```

### Setup 3: Earnings Swing (Post-Announcement)

**The Strategy:**
- Stock gaps on earnings
- Settles into new trading range
- Swing trade the new range extremes

**Example:**

```
Stock: TSLA (earnings released after hours)
- Pre-earnings price: $850.00
- Post-earnings gap up: $865.00
- 4-day consolidation: $860-$875 range

Swing Trade Plan:
Entry 1 (on pullback): 40 shares @ $862.00
Stop Loss: $858.00 (-$160 total)
Target 1: $870.00 (+$320)
Target 2: $875.00 (+$520)

Entry 2 (breakout): 25 shares @ $876.00
Stop Loss: $872.00 (-$100 total)
Target: $885.00 (+$225)

Total Risk: $260 (1.3% on $20K)
Total Position: 65 shares
Hold: 5-8 days
```

## Swing Trading with 4-Hour Charts

### Why 4-Hour Charts?
- Filters out intraday noise
- Captures swings within the daily trend
- Better entry precision than daily charts
- Identifies optimal entry within daily range

### 4-Hour Chart Setup Example

```
Daily Trend: UPTREND (price > 20-day MA)
4-Hour Setup: Consolidation breakout

Daily High: $242.50
Daily Low: $238.00

Within the day, 4-hour consolidation forms:
- High: $241.00
- Low: $239.50

Swing Trade:
- Entry: $241.10 (breakout above 4-hour high)
- Stop: $239.00 (below 4-hour consolidation)
- Target: Previous 4-hour high + range extension
- Hold: 2-8 hours, extend if still in trend
```

## Indicator Selection for Swing Trading

### Key Indicators

#### 1. Moving Averages (20-day, 50-day, 200-day)
```
Usage:
- 20-day MA: Short-term trend confirmation
- 50-day MA: Entry pullback level
- 200-day MA: Long-term trend direction

Example:
Price > 50-day MA > 200-day MA = UPTREND confirmed
Can buy pullbacks to 50-day MA
```

#### 2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
```
Settings: 14-period
- RSI > 70: Overbought (potential pullback)
- RSI < 30: Oversold (potential bounce)
- Divergence: Price high but RSI lower = reversal signal

Swing Trading Usage:
- Enter long when RSI bounces off 30 (oversold)
- Exit when RSI approaches 70 (overbought)
- Look for divergence for trend reversals
```

#### 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
```
Components:
- MACD line (fast)
- Signal line (slow)
- Histogram (difference)

Swing Trading Signals:
- BUY: MACD crosses above signal line
- SELL: MACD crosses below signal line
- Divergence: MACD strengthening but price weakening = reversal

Example:
Stock in uptrend
MACD crosses above signal line → BUY signal
Hold through higher lows
Exit on MACD cross below signal line or divergence
```

#### 4. Bollinger Bands
```
Settings: 20-period, 2 standard deviations

Usage:
- Price near upper band: Potential resistance/exit
- Price near lower band: Potential support/entry
- Band squeeze: Low volatility, breakout coming
- Band expansion: High volatility, trend acceleration

Swing Trade Example:
- Price bounces at lower band → BUY
- Set stop below lower band
- Target: Upper band or previous resistance
```

## Common Swing Trading Mistakes

1. **Too large position sizes**: Risk explodes if stop hit
2. **Ignoring daily chart**: Entering against main trend
3. **Holding through earnings**: Overnight gap risk in swing position
4. **Moving stop loss down**: Removes exit discipline
5. **Holding winners too long**: Giving back profits on reversal
6. **Not scaling into positions**: Missing position on dips
7. **Over-trading**: Taking marginal setups instead of high-quality ones

## Swing Trading Timeframe Rules

- **Minimum hold**: 2-3 days (let trade develop)
- **Maximum hold**: 12-14 days (swing deteriorates)
- **Optimal hold**: 5-8 days (best reward/risk window)
- **Weekly rebalance**: Check positions every Friday

## Summary

Swing trading bridges day trading and position trading:
- Holds positions 3-14 days for 2%-8% gains
- Uses daily and 4-hour charts for setups
- Employs moving average pullbacks and chart patterns
- Manages 3-4 positions simultaneously
- Risk of 1%-1.5% per position for portfolio diversification

Key to success: Patience for setup quality and discipline on exits.

## Key Takeaways

1. Higher lows with higher highs identify uptrend swings
2. Pullbacks to 50-day MA provide high-probability entries
3. Use 4-hour charts for entry precision within daily trend
4. Scale positions to 1.5% risk each for multiple holdings
5. Partial profit-taking at 1:1 locks in gains
6. Hold remaining position for 2:1+ targets
7. Exit on MACD/RSI divergence or time/target hit

## Next Steps

- Chart study: Identify 5 stocks showing higher lows/highs pattern
- Practice entries: Set entry orders at 50-day MA pullbacks
- Journal trade: Record all setups and outcomes
- Refine technique: Specialize in 2-3 chart patterns
