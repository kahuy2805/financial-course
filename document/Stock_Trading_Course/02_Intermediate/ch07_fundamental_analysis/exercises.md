## Section 1: Introduction to Fundamental Analysis (Lesson 7.1)

### Question 1.1
What are the three pillars of fundamental analysis?

**Answer:**
1. Financial Statements (Is the company profitable?)
2. Valuation Metrics (Is the stock cheap or expensive?)
3. Business Quality (Does the company have a moat?)

### Question 1.2
A stock is trading at P/E of 10. Does this mean it's a good buy? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Not necessarily. Low P/E could mean:
- Company is undervalued (good buy)
- Company is in decline, no growth (value trap, bad buy)
- Industry is cyclical, profits temporarily low (good timing or bad timing depends on cycle)
Must check fundamentals to see if it's truly undervalued.

### Question 1.3
What does a "moat" mean in business context?

**Answer:** A competitive advantage that's hard for competitors to copy. Examples:
- Brand strength (Apple)
- Network effects (Facebook)
- Switching costs (Microsoft Office)
- Cost advantage (Walmart)

### Question 1.4
Why is free cash flow more important than accounting profit?

**Answer:** Profit can be fiction due to accounting rules. Free cash flow is real cash the company generates. A company can show $1B profit on paper but have negative cash flow (impossible to pay dividends or debts).

---

## Section 2: Reading Financial Statements (Lesson 7.2)

### Question 2.1
What's the difference between the Income Statement and Balance Sheet?

**Answer:**
- **Income Statement**: Shows profit and loss over a period (like monthly profit statement)
- **Balance Sheet**: Shows what company owns and owes at a point in time (like a snapshot)

### Question 2.2
A company has:
- Revenue: $1000M
- Net Income: $100M
- Is this good or bad?

**Answer:** Need more context, but net margin of 10% is solid for most businesses. But compare to:
- Historical margins (are they expanding or compressing?)
- Industry average (10% could be great for some, bad for others)

### Question 2.3
What's the formula for Free Cash Flow?

**Answer:**
Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures = Free Cash Flow

Or: Cash Flow Statement Operating Activities minus CapEx

### Question 2.4
A company shows $100M in profit but only $20M in free cash flow. What could explain this?

**Answer:** Several possibilities:
1. Large capital expenditure (building factories, equipment)
2. Working capital bloating (huge accounts receivable increase)
3. Profit is being deferred (customer pays next quarter)
4. Profit includes non-cash items (depreciation, one-time gains)

This is why FCF is watched more carefully than accounting profit.

## Section 3: Key Financial Ratios (Lesson 7.3)

### Question 3.1
Calculate the following ratios:

Given:
- Stock Price: $75
- EPS: $3
- Book Value Per Share: $20
- Net Income: $300M
- Shareholders' Equity: $2000M
- Total Debt: $800M

**Answer Key:**
1. P/E Ratio: 75 ÷ 3 = 25
2. P/B Ratio: 75 ÷ 20 = 3.75
3. ROE: 300 ÷ 2000 = 15%
4. D/E Ratio: 800 ÷ 2000 = 0.40

### Question 3.2
Is the stock expensive or cheap based on P/E of 25?

**Answer:** Depends on context:
- S&P 500 average P/E: ~20
- Technology sector P/E: ~25-30
- If this is a tech stock: Fair to slightly cheap
- If this is a utility: Expensive
- Must compare to sector, not just market

### Question 3.3
What does ROE of 15% mean?

**Answer:** Company generates 15% return on shareholder capital. This is good (above average 10%, but below excellent 20%+). Shows the company is using shareholder money efficiently.

### Question 3.4
Is D/E ratio of 0.40 good or bad?

**Answer:** Very good. Shows:
- For every $1 of equity, company has $0.40 of debt
- Leveraged but safe
- Strong balance sheet with room to borrow if needed
- Low bankruptcy risk

## Section 4: Earnings Reports (Lesson 7.4)

### Question 4.1
What's the difference between beating EPS and beating revenue?

**Answer:**
- **Beat EPS**: Made more profit than expected (often by cutting costs)
- **Beat Revenue**: Sold more than expected

EPS beat with revenue miss = Company cut costs (margin compression = bad long-term)
Revenue beat with EPS miss = Sales strong but margins weak (also concerning)
Best scenario: Beat both

### Question 4.2
A company beats EPS estimates but cuts forward guidance. Is this bullish or bearish?

**Answer:** Bearish. The market cares more about FUTURE profits than past. Beating current quarter but cutting guidance = Future looks worse = Stock drops despite beat.

### Question 4.3
What's the typical stock reaction to an earnings beat?

**Answer:** Usually up 2-10% same day, depending on:
- How big the beat (1% beat vs. 10% beat)
- Quality of guidance
- Industry expectations
- Market sentiment

---

## Section 5: Industry and Sector Analysis (Lesson 7.5)

### Question 5.1
Why do different industries have different P/E multiples?

**Answer:** Different expected growth and risk:
- Tech (P/E 25-35): High growth expected, more risk
- Utilities (P/E 12-18): Stable but slow growth, less risk
- Investors pay premium for growth, discount for stability

### Question 5.2
What does "sector rotation" mean?

**Answer:** Different sectors outperform in different economic cycles:
- Recovery: Cyclicals lead (Industrial, Energy)
- Expansion: Growth leads (Tech, Consumer Discretionary)
- Slowdown: Defensive leads (Staples, Utilities)
- Recession: Safe havens (Treasuries, Gold)

### Question 5.3
Is a company in a declining industry always a bad buy?

**Answer:** Usually yes, but not always:
- Great company can outperform declining industry (Costco in retail)
- But fighting industry headwinds = much harder
- Generally avoid dying industries (print media, DVD rentals)

---

## Section 6: Economic Indicators (Lesson 7.6)

### Question 6.1
What's the most important economic indicator for stock market?

**Answer:** Federal Funds Rate. When it rises, it hurts growth stocks. When it falls, it helps. This drives Fed decisions which drive everything else.

### Question 6.2
What does an inverted yield curve mean?

**Answer:** Short-term interest rates are higher than long-term. This is unusual and signals:
- Market expects recession
- Fed will have to cut rates soon
- Historically precedes every recession

### Question 6.3
A jobs report beats expectations. Is this bullish or bearish for stocks?

**Answer:** It depends:
- Bullish: If Fed already finished raising rates (showing strength)
- Bearish: If Fed is still hiking rates (means more hikes coming)
- Context matters more than the number itself

### Question 6.4
What should you watch before making a big investment decision?

**Answer:**
- Federal rate direction (rising or falling?)
- Inflation rate (above or below target?)
- Employment trend (strong or weakening?)
- GDP growth (accelerating or slowing?)
- Yield curve (normal or inverted?)

If uncertain on these macro factors, reduce position size.

## Section 7: Combining Technical and Fundamental (Lesson 7.7)

### Question 7.1
You find a great company (strong fundamentals, cheap P/E) but the technical chart is breaking down. What should you do?

**Answer:** Wait for technical recovery before buying.

Reasons:
- Stock might fall 20% more before bottoming
- Buying during technical breakdown = poor timing
- Even if right long-term, terrible experience
- Better to buy on bounce (technical recovery)
- Or scale in gradually over multiple weeks

### Question 7.2
Technical setup is perfect (breaking above resistance, volume surging) but fundamentals are deteriorating (revenue down, margins compressed). What should you do?

**Answer:** Avoid the trade completely.

Reasons:
- Breakout often fails when company is struggling
- Next earnings could be disaster
- Risk/reward is poor
- Find stocks with BOTH fundamentals and technicals aligned

### Question 7.3
What's a good risk/reward ratio for a trade?

**Answer:**
- Minimum: 1:2 (Risk $1 to make $2)
- Good: 1:3 (Risk $1 to make $3)
- Excellent: 1:5 or better

Position sizing matters too: Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade.
