### The Three Financial Statements

Every publicly traded company publishes three statements quarterly and annually:

1. **Income Statement** - Profit and Loss
2. **Balance Sheet** - Assets and Liabilities
3. **Cash Flow Statement** - Cash Movement

### Statement 1: Income Statement (P&L)

**What It Shows:** Revenue, expenses, and profit over a period (quarter or year).

**The Formula:**
```
Revenue (top line)
- Cost of Goods Sold
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
= Operating Income
- Interest Expense
= Income Before Taxes
- Taxes
= Net Income (bottom line)
```

**Real Example: Apple Income Statement (Fiscal 2023)**

```
Total Net Sales (Revenue):                 $383,285 million
Cost of Sales:                             $214,137 million
                                           ─────────────────
Gross Profit:                              $169,148 million
                                           (44.1% margin)

Operating Expenses:
  Research & Development:   $29,915M
  SG&A (Selling, General):  $26,291M
  Total Operating Exp:      $56,206 million
                                           ─────────────────
Operating Income:                          $112,942 million
                                           (29.4% margin)

Other income/expense:                      $10,045 million
Income before taxes:                       $122,987 million
Provision for income taxes:                $23,601 million
                                           ─────────────────
Net Income:                                $99,386 million
```

**Key Metrics to Watch:**

| Metric | What It Means | Good Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Revenue Growth** | Is company selling more? | 5-15% yearly growth |
| **Gross Margin** | Profit before operating costs | 30-50% for healthy companies |
| **Operating Margin** | Profit after operating costs | 10-30% for healthy companies |
| **Net Margin** | Final profit after all costs | 5-20% for healthy companies |

**Real Example: Comparing Margins**

```
Apple:
- Net Income: $99.4B on Revenue $383.3B
- Net Margin: 99.4 ÷ 383.3 = 25.9%
- Interpretation: For every $1 of sales, keep $0.26 profit

Walmart:
- Net Income: $15.5B on Revenue $611.3B
- Net Margin: 15.5 ÷ 611.3 = 2.5%
- Interpretation: For every $1 of sales, keep $0.025 profit

Why the difference?
- Apple: High-margin tech/services (sells $1000 phones)
- Walmart: Low-margin retail (sells $5 items with small markup)

Both can be excellent businesses, just different models
```

**Reading the Income Statement:**

**Question 1: Is revenue growing?**
```
Year 1 Revenue: $100M
Year 2 Revenue: $110M (10% growth) ✓ GOOD
Year 3 Revenue: $115M (4.5% growth) ✗ SLOWING
```

**Question 2: Are expenses growing slower than revenue?**
```
Revenue grew 10%, but expenses grew 15% = Margin compression
This means profits are shrinking even though sales are growing (PROBLEM)

Revenue grew 10%, expenses grew 5% = Margin expansion
This means profits are growing faster than sales (EXCELLENT)
```

**Question 3: What's the trend in profit?**
```
Year 1 Net Income: $10M
Year 2 Net Income: $12M (20% growth) ✓ GOOD
Year 3 Net Income: $11M (8% decline) ✗ WARNING
```

### Statement 2: Balance Sheet

**What It Shows:** What the company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time.

**The Formula:**
```
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

This always balances (that's why it's called a balance sheet)
```

**Real Example: Apple Balance Sheet (Sept 2023)**

```
ASSETS:
Current Assets:
  Cash and Cash Equivalents:           $29,965 million
  Short-term Investments:             $32,896 million

Total Current Assets:                  $135,405 million

Fixed Assets:
  Property, Plant, Equipment:          $42,017 million

  Other Long-term Liabilities:         $49,848 million
                                       ──────────────

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:
Common Stock:                          $73,812 million
Retained Earnings:                     ($11,446) million
                                       ──────────────
TOTAL EQUITY:                          $60,366 million
                                       ──────────────
Total Liabilities + Equity:            $352,180 million ✓ Balances!
```

**Key Metrics on Balance Sheet:**

| Section | What It Means | What You Want |
|---|---|---|
| **Current Assets** | Cash and things easily convertible to cash | Higher is better |
| **Current Liabilities** | Debts due within 1 year | Lower is better |
| **Long-term Debt** | Loans the company owes | Lower is better (or manageable) |
| **Shareholders' Equity** | Owner's stake (Assets - Liabilities) | Growing over time |

**Real Example: Financial Strength**

```
Company A:
- Total Assets: $1000M
- Total Liabilities: $100M
- Shareholders' Equity: $900M
- Debt-to-Equity: 0.11 (very low debt, very safe)
✓ Financially strong

Company B:
- Total Assets: $1000M
- Total Liabilities: $800M
- Shareholders' Equity: $200M
- Debt-to-Equity: 4.0 (very high debt, very risky)
✗ Financially weak

In economic downturns, Company A survives and Company B might go bankrupt
```

**Reading the Balance Sheet:**

**Question 1: Does the company have enough cash?**
```
Current Assets: $500M
Current Liabilities: $200M
Working Capital: $300M (excess cash available) ✓ GOOD
```

**Question 2: Is debt manageable?**
```
Long-term Debt: $100M
Annual Operating Income: $200M
Debt-to-EBIT ratio: 0.5 (low debt) ✓ GOOD

Long-term Debt: $500M
Annual Operating Income: $200M
Debt-to-EBIT ratio: 2.5 (high debt) ✗ RISKY
```

**Question 3: Is equity growing?**
```
Year 1 Shareholders' Equity: $500M
Year 2 Shareholders' Equity: $550M (growing) ✓ GOOD
Year 3 Shareholders' Equity: $580M (continuing to grow) ✓ GOOD
```

### Statement 3: Cash Flow Statement

**What It Shows:** Where cash came from and where it went during the period.

**Why It's Important:** Profit on the income statement is often not the same as cash in the bank.

**Real Example: Profit vs. Cash**

```
Scenario: Company sells $1000 in products but on credit (customer pays in 90 days)

Income Statement:
- Revenue: $1000 ✓ (revenue recognized immediately)
- Net Income: $500 (profit)

Cash Flow Statement:
- Operating Cash Flow: $0 (customer hasn't paid yet!)

Difference: Company shows $500 profit but has $0 cash
This is why cash flow matters!
```

**The Formula:**
```
Operating Cash Flow
  = Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization
    ± Changes in Working Capital
    ± Changes in Payables/Receivables

Free Cash Flow
  = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
```

**Real Example: Apple Cash Flow Statement**

```
Operating Activities:
  Net Income:                          $99,386 million
  Adjustments:
    Depreciation & Amortization:       $12,763 million
    Stock-based Compensation:          $8,708 million
  Changes in Working Capital:          ($5,338) million
                                       ─────────────────
Operating Cash Flow:                   $110,543 million

Investing Activities:
  Capital Expenditures:                ($10,949) million
  Purchases of Investments:            ($7,191) million
                                       ─────────────────
Free Cash Flow:                        $99,594 million

Financing Activities:
  Debt Payments:                       ($3,000) million
  Share Buybacks:                      ($73,086) million
  Dividends Paid:                      ($14,841) million
                                       ─────────────────
Net Change in Cash:                    $8,667 million
```

**Key Metrics on Cash Flow:**

| Metric | What It Means | What You Want |
|---|---|---|
| **Operating Cash Flow** | Cash generated from business | Growing and positive |
| **Free Cash Flow** | Cash available after investments | Growing and positive |
| **Capital Expenditures** | Money spent on equipment, factories | Should be reasonable % of revenue |
| **Share Buybacks** | Company buying back its own stock | Shows management confidence |

**Reading the Cash Flow Statement:**

**Question 1: Is the company generating cash?**
```
Operating Cash Flow: $100M
- This is the most important number
- If positive and growing, company is healthy
- If negative, company is burning cash
```

**Question 2: How much free cash flow?**
```
Operating Cash Flow: $100M
Capital Expenditures: $20M (needed for growth)
Free Cash Flow: $80M

Free Cash Flow / Revenue = 80/500 = 16%
Good benchmark: 5-15% for healthy companies
This company is at upper end (EXCELLENT)
```

**Question 3: What's the company doing with excess cash?**
```
Option A: Paying dividends (returning to shareholders)
Option B: Reinvesting (building factories, R&D)
Option C: Paying down debt (strengthening balance sheet)
Option D: Buybacks (rewarding shareholders)

Best answer: Mix of all four depending on company stage
```

### Putting It All Together

**Complete Financial Picture:**

```
INCOME STATEMENT shows: Is the company profitable?
↓
- If yes, profit is growing?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Only Looking at Net Income

**Problem:** Company has $10M profit, so you think it's good. You don't check if cash flow is negative.

**Solution:** Check all three statements. Profit means nothing if cash flow is negative.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Changes in Working Capital

**Problem:** Revenue growing fast, but accounts receivable ballooning. Cash isn't coming in fast enough.

**Solution:** Compare revenue growth to cash flow growth. Should be roughly aligned.

### Mistake #3: Confusing GAAP and Non-GAAP

**Problem:** Company reports two different profit numbers. Not sure which is real.

**Solution:** Use GAAP (official) numbers. Non-GAAP often excludes bad items to look better.

### Mistake #4: Not Adjusting for One-Time Items

**Problem:** Company had one-time gain on sale of asset. Profits look inflated.

**Solution:** Remove one-time gains/losses to understand recurring profitability.

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Depreciation and Amortization

**Problem:** Company has big depreciation, so accounting profit is low. But it's non-cash.

**Solution:** Understand depreciation is non-cash. Add it back to understand true cash generation.
