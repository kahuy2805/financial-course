### Why Economic Indicators Matter

**Economic Indicators** are statistics released regularly (monthly, quarterly, annually) that measure the health of the economy.

**Why They Matter for Stock Market:**

```
Strong Economy →
  → Companies earn more profit →
  → Stock valuations justify premium multiples →
  → Stocks rally

Weak Economy →
  → Companies earn less profit →
  → Investors become pessimistic →
  → Stock valuations compress →
  → Stocks sell off
```

**Real Example: Fed Rate Increases (2022-2023)**

```
2022 Fed Action: Raised rates from 0% to 4.25%
Market Reaction:
- Tech stocks down 65% (growth stocks hurt by higher rates)
- Financial stocks up (banks earn more on deposits)
- Defensive stocks stable (utilities hold value)

Why?
- Higher rates make future growth less valuable
- Tech companies with future growth hurt most
- Banks benefit from wider deposit/lending spread
```

### The Most Important Economic Indicators

#### 1. Federal Funds Rate (Interest Rates)

**What It Is:** The interest rate banks charge each other overnight. The Fed controls this.

**Why It Matters:**
- Highest impact on stock market
- Affects all borrowing costs
- Rising rates = Headwind for stocks (especially growth)
- Falling rates = Tailwind for stocks

**Release Schedule:** 8 times per year (Fed meetings)

**Real Example: Rate Cut Expectations**

```
July 2023: Fed Rate = 5.25-5.50% (highest in 22 years)
Market Expectation: Rate cuts coming in 2024
Result: Stock market rallies, anticipating easier conditions

December 2023: Fed Rate = 5.25-5.50% (held steady)
Market Expectation: Cut by March 2024
Result: Market rallies further on cut anticipation
```

#### 2. Inflation (CPI - Consumer Price Index)

**What It Is:** Rate at which prices increase for everyday goods.

**Formula:**
```
Current Month Price: $100
Prior Year Price: $98
CPI Inflation: 2.04% (annualized)
```

**Why It Matters:**
- High inflation = Fed raises rates
- Raising rates = Bad for stocks
- Low inflation = Fed can keep rates low
- Low rates = Good for stocks

**Release Schedule:** Monthly (around 10th of month)

**Target Rate:** 2% per year

**Real Example: Inflation Spike**

```
2021-2022: Inflation spiked to 9% (highest since 1981)
Market Reaction:
- Fed rapidly raised rates
- Stock market crashed 35-40%
- Bonds fell too (safe havens didn't help)

Reason:
- High inflation forces Fed to fight it
- Fighting inflation = Higher rates
- Higher rates = Hurt growth stocks, compress multiples
```

#### 3. Employment Data (Job Reports)

**What It Shows:** How many jobs were created/lost, unemployment rate.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Non-Farm Payrolls**: Number of jobs added/lost (main metric)
- **Unemployment Rate**: % of workforce without jobs (target 4-5%)
- **Labor Force Participation**: % of working-age population employed

**Release Schedule:** First Friday of each month

**Why It Matters:**
- Strong job growth = Strong economy = Companies hire more = Profits grow
- Weak job growth = Weak economy = Companies cut spending = Profits decline

**Real Example: Post-COVID Boom**

```
2021-2022: Booming job market
- Monthly job additions: 300k-500k
- Unemployment: 3.5% (50-year low)
- Market reaction: Rallied (strong economy)

But hidden problem:
- Tight labor market = Wage inflation
- Wage inflation = Profit margin pressure
- Profit margin pressure = Eventually Fed raises rates
- Result: In 2022, market crashed as rates rose
```

#### 4. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

**What It Is:** Total value of all goods and services produced in a country per quarter.

**Example:**
```
Q2 2023 GDP Growth: 2.4% (annualized)
Interpretation: Economy grew 2.4% in that quarter

Healthy range: 2-3% annualized
Weak: Below 2%
Recession: Negative (economy shrinking)
```

**Release Schedule:** Quarterly (1 month after quarter ends, revised twice)

**Why It Matters:**
- GDP growth = Company profits can grow
- Negative GDP = Recession, profits shrink
- Market historically down 20-40% in recessions

**Real Example: Post-Pandemic Recovery**

```
2020: COVID Crash
- Q2 GDP: -31% (worst quarter ever)
- Market: Down 35%

2021: Recovery
- Q1 GDP: +6.3% (rapid recovery)
- Market: Rallied 50% from March 2020 lows

Lesson:
- When GDP turning positive, stock market often leads
- Buy when recession looks worst (GDP most negative)
```

#### 5. Treasury Bond Yields

**What It Is:** Interest rate the government pays on its debt (10-year most watched).

**Why It Matters:**
- Governs ALL other interest rates in economy
- Higher yields = Higher cost of borrowing for companies
- Rising yields = Bad for growth stocks, good for value/bonds
- Falling yields = Good for growth stocks, bad for bonds

**The 10-Year Yield:**
- Below 2% = Extremely loose conditions (very bullish)
- 2-3% = Normal, moderate growth
- 3-4% = Tightening (caution)
- 4%+ = High rates, economic pressure

**Real Example: Yield Curve (Inversion)**

```
Normal Yield Curve (Bullish):
- 2-year Treasury: 3.5%
- 10-year Treasury: 4.2%
- Long-term higher (investors demand premium for longer risk)

Inverted Yield Curve (Bearish):
- 2-year Treasury: 5.0%
- 10-year Treasury: 4.2%
- Short-term higher (market expects rates to fall/recession)
- EVERY inverted yield curve preceded a recession
```

#### 6. Wage Growth (Average Hourly Earnings)

**What It Is:** How fast worker salaries are increasing.

**Why It Matters:**
- Wage growth above 3-4% = Inflation risk, rate hike risk
- Wage growth below 2% = Weak economy, possible rate cuts
- Workers earning more = Spend more = Companies sell more

**Real Example: 2022 Wage Inflation**

```
Wage Growth 2022: 5-6% (rapid)
Problem: Wages growing 5%, inflation 8%
Result: Real wages falling (workers getting poorer)

Market impact:
- Workers feeling squeezed
- Consumer spending slowing
- Companies reporting margin compression
- Fed forced to raise rates further
```

### Economic Calendar

**Key Indicators Released Each Month:**

```
EARLY MONTH:
- Non-Farm Payrolls (1st Friday) ← MAJOR
- ISM Manufacturing Index (1st business day)

MID MONTH:
- Retail Sales (2nd week)
- Consumer Price Index / Inflation (2nd week) ← MAJOR

LATE MONTH:
- Consumer Sentiment (last Friday)
- New Home Sales (last few days)

QUARTERLY:
- GDP (1st day of month, 3 times - first, second, third estimate)
- Fed Meeting (8x per year) ← MAJOR
```

### How to Trade Economic Data

**The Calendar:**

```
Day Before: Market anticipates what number will be
            Prices adjust based on expectations

Day Of:
- 8:30 AM ET: Number is released (all at same time)
- MASSIVE market reaction (within 10 seconds)
- Often 2-5% move in S&P 500 on surprises

First Hour: Wild volatility as algorithms and traders react

Rest of Day: Consolidation and further digestion
```

**Trading the Surprise:**

```
Estimate: 300k jobs added
Actual: 500k jobs added (BEAT by 200k)
Market reaction: Stock market rallies
Why? Stronger economy than expected

Opposite:
Estimate: 300k jobs added
Actual: 100k jobs added (MISS by 200k)
Market reaction: Stock market sells off
Why? Weaker economy than expected
```

**Real Example: NFP Surprise**

```
January 2023 Employment Report:
Estimate: 185k jobs
Actual: 517k jobs (HUGE BEAT)
Market reaction: S&P 500 up 2.2% same day
Reason: Unexpected strength, but also means Fed won't cut rates soon

Later analysis: Market realized this is bad (no rate cuts coming)
Next week: Sold off 2-3% as rate cut hopes faded
```

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (Point to future):
- Yield curve (inverted = recession coming)
- Consumer confidence
- Housing starts
- Initial jobless claims

**Lagging Indicators** (Confirm past):
- Unemployment rate (lags peak of recession)
- GDP (reported after quarter ends)
- Corporate profits

**Best Strategy:** Watch leading indicators to anticipate, use lagging indicators to confirm.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Assuming Strong Economy Always = Good for Stocks

**Problem:** GDP strong, so you buy. But if strong GDP means Fed raises rates, could be bad.

**Solution:** Track the interest rate implications, not just GDP.

### Mistake #2: Trading Every Economic Data Release

**Problem:** Employment report beat, so you buy. Next week Fed says more rate hikes. Stock crashes.

**Solution:** Wait for full picture. One number doesn't change the trend.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Yield Curve

**Problem:** 10-year yields rising but you ignore. Market crashes on recession recession fears.

**Solution:** Inverted yield curve is one of best recession predictors. Pay attention.

### Mistake #4: Forgetting Time Lag Between Data and Action

**Problem:** Inflation released today at 8%, market should sell off. But market already priced this in days ago.

**Solution:** Check what economists expected. The SURPRISE matters, not the absolute number.

### Mistake #5: Not Adjusting for Seasonal Effects

**Problem:** January retail sales up 5%. You think economy strong. But January always up (holiday season).

**Solution:** Look at year-over-year comparisons, not month-to-month.
