**Scenario A: You follow the 1% rule**
- Trade 1 loss: -$100, account = $9,900
- Trade 2 loss: -$99, account = $9,801
- Trade 3 loss: -$98, account = $9,703
- After 10 losses: account = $_________

**Scenario B: You double your risk after losing (revenge trading)**
- Trade 1 loss at 2%: -$200, account = $9,800
- Trade 2 loss at 4%: -$392, account = $9,408
- Trade 3 loss at 8%: -$752, account = $8,656
- After 3-4 losses: account = $_________ (likely wiped)

**Question:** Why do traders fall into this trap even though the math is clear?

## Exercise Set 6: Real-World Scenario Analysis

These are comprehensive scenarios that test multiple concepts.

### Exercise 6.1: The "Hot Stock" Dilemma

**Scenario:**

You see Apple trending up. Everyone on social media is talking about it. You believe it will continue up.

Current price: $150
Support: $140
Resistance: $170

Your account: $15,000

**Your temptation:** Risk 5% (instead of 1%) because "this is a sure thing"

**Analysis:**

**If you follow the rule (1% risk):**
- Risk amount: $________
- Position size: _________ shares (assuming stop at $140)
- Position value: $_________
- If you're wrong: Account = $14,850 (still trading)

**If you break the rule (5% risk):**
- Risk amount: $________
- Position size: _________ shares
- Position value: $_________
- If you're wrong: Account = $14,250 (still okay)
- If you have 2 losses: Account = $_________ (problematic)

**Key question:** Why is it harder to follow the rule when you feel confident?

### Exercise 6.2: The Losing Streak

**Scenario:**

You had bad luck. You've lost 5 trades in a row.

Starting account: $15,000
After 5 losses at 1% per trade: $14,250

Now you're at $14,250, and you see another setup. But emotionally, you want to "make it back faster."

The setup:
- Entry: $100
- Support: $90 (you want stop there)
- Resistance: $120
- Normal 1% risk would be: $143 (not fitting the typical position)

**Your emotional choice:** Risk 3% ($427) instead of 1% to "speed up recovery"

**Analysis:**

**If you follow the rule (1% risk):**
- Risk: $143
- Position size: _________ shares
- If you win: Account = $14,393 (small recovery)
- If you lose: Account = $14,107 (slightly worse)

**If you break the rule (3% risk):**
- Risk: $427
- Position size: _________ shares
- If you win: Account = $14,677 (better recovery)
- If you lose: Account = $13,823 (much worse, closer to panic zone)

**Question:** What's the math telling you about revenge trading?

### Exercise 6.3: Building Your First Real Portfolio

**Your situation:**

- Account: $18,000
- Time available: 1 hour daily
- Experience: Beginner
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (1% per trade)

**Your goal:** Build a diversified portfolio of 5-6 stocks

**Step 1: List 6 stocks you're interested in**

1. __________________ (Sector: ___________)
2. __________________ (Sector: ___________)
3. __________________ (Sector: ___________)
4. __________________ (Sector: ___________)
5. __________________ (Sector: ___________)
6. __________________ (Sector: ___________)

**Step 2: Research and set parameters**

For each stock, research and fill in:

| Stock | Entry | Support | Resistance | Stop | Target | Ratio |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |
| 2 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |
| 3 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |
| 4 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |
| 5 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |
| 6 | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | $____ | 1:___ |

**Step 3: Calculate position sizes**

For each stock:
- Risk amount: 1% of $18,000 = $180
- Stop distance: (Entry - Stop)
- Position size: $180 ÷ Stop distance
- Position value: Position size × Entry

**Step 4: Verify ratios**

All ratios should be ≥ 1:1.5. If not, adjust entry/stop/target.

**Step 5: Check portfolio balance**

- Sector allocation: Any sector >40%? Yes/No
- Market cap distribution: Have large, mid, and small caps? Yes/No
- Position sizes: Largest <50%, smallest >5%? Yes/No
- Total positions: _______ (should be 5-6)

**Step 6: Final commitment**

Are you ready to enter these 6 positions? Yes/No

If no, what needs to change?

## Exercise Set 7: Reflection and Mastery

### Exercise 7.1: The Rules You'll Follow

Write down the three rules you commit to:

**Rule 1: Risk Management**
"I will never risk more than ______% of my account on a single trade. This means with 1% risk, even 10 consecutive losses only cost me 10% of my account, which is survivable."

**Rule 2: Stop Losses**
"I will place a stop loss on EVERY trade, based on technical support levels, not arbitrary prices. I will never adjust my stop loss wider once placed, only tighter once profitable."

**Rule 3: Position Sizing**
"My position size will be determined by the formula: (Account × Risk %) ÷ Stop Distance. I will not override this formula based on emotion or conviction."

### Exercise 7.2: Your Risk Management Weakness

**Question:** What aspect of risk management is hardest for you?

- [ ] Following 1% risk (feels too small)
- [ ] Placing stops at technical levels (prefer closer stops)
- [ ] Accepting losses quickly (want to see more pain)
- [ ] Refusing to revenge trade (want to make back losses)
- [ ] Diversifying enough (prefer to concentrate)
- [ ] Other: _________________

**Your response plan:**

Write down HOW you'll overcome this weakness:

"My weakness is: _______________________________

I will overcome this by: _________________________

If I struggle with this, I will: ____________________"

### Exercise 7.3: The Capital Preservation Mindset

**Answer these questions honestly:**

1. Would you rather:
   - A) Make 50% on 2 trades, then lose 40% on 1 trade (net: +20% but with high volatility)
   - B) Make 5% on 20 trades, then lose 3% on 2 trades (net: +94% but smooth)

2. What appeals to you about stock trading?
   - The potential for fast riches?
   - Building wealth over time?
   - Testing your analytical skills?
   - Having control over your investments?

3. If your first year of trading produced:
   - 10% annual return with 8% maximum drawdown (small losing streaks)
   - 8% annual return with 15% maximum drawdown (larger losing streaks)

   Which would you prefer?

**Reflection:**

"My ideal outcome from trading is: _______________________

I'm willing to accept ___% annual returns to achieve portfolio safety.

The most important thing to me in trading is: _______________"

## Next Steps

**After completing Chapter 3:**

You now have a complete foundation in risk management. Everything you learned here applies to all future trading, no matter what strategy you use.

**Before moving forward:**

1. Spend at least 1 week with these concepts
2. Practice position sizing on paper (not real money yet)
3. Practice identifying stops and targets on real stocks
4. Build your first paper portfolio
5. Track your calculations for accuracy

**Your next chapter will build on this foundation:**

Chapter 4 will teach you how to actually analyze stocks and find trading opportunities - but only using the risk management framework you've just mastered.

---

## Resources for Practice

**Free Tools to Use:**

- StockCharts.com (free charting software)
- TradingView (free charts and analysis)
- Yahoo Finance (free stock data)
- Your brokerage's paper trading account (practice without real money)

**Practice Suggestion:**

For the next 2 weeks:
1. Identify 3 stocks per day
2. Calculate position size and stop loss for each
3. Journal which ones you'd take and which you'd skip (and why)
4. Don't trade yet - just practice the math

**Mastery Benchmark:**

You'll know you've mastered this chapter when:
- You can calculate position size in less than 2 minutes
- You identify support/resistance levels confidently
- You understand why you'd skip 80% of opportunities (due to bad ratios)
- The three rules feel automatic, not restrictive

---

**Remember:** Risk management isn't the exciting part of trading. But it's the part that determines whether you're a trader for 30 years or 30 days.
