## Common Questions

**Q: Do I really need to do all 9 exercises?**
A: Yes. Each one addresses a different weakness. Skip them and you skip the preparation your psychology needs.

A: Minimum. Most successful traders do 100-200. You need enough to test your system and build habits.

**Q: Can I skip to real money faster?**
A: You can, but 85% of traders who do fail within 6 months. The 4-6 weeks of preparation saves you thousands in losses.

**Q: Do I need to sign the paper trading contract?**

**Q: What if I can't complete 100 paper trades?**
