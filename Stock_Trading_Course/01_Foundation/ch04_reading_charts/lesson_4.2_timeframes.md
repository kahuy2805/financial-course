## Overview

A timeframe (or "time period") determines what data each candle represents. A 1-minute chart shows price movement compressed into 1-minute blocks. A daily chart shows entire trading days compressed into single candles. In this lesson, you'll learn all common timeframes, how to choose the right one, and how the same stock looks completely different on different timeframes.

**Time to complete:** 20-25 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 4.1 (Understanding Price Charts)
- Access to a charting platform (TradingView, broker, Yahoo Finance)
- Comfortable with candlestick concepts

---

## Core Content

### What is a Timeframe?

A **timeframe** is the time period represented by each candle on a chart.

**Simple Analogy:**
- 1-minute chart = Weather recorded every 1 minute
- 5-minute chart = Weather recorded every 5 minutes
- Daily chart = Weather recorded once per day
- Weekly chart = Weather recorded once per week

Same weather, different time compression.

### Why Timeframes Matter

**The Same Stock Looks Different on Different Timeframes:**

Imagine you check Apple stock:
- On a 1-minute chart: Looks chaotic and random
- On a 5-minute chart: Still volatile but patterns emerge
- On a 1-hour chart: Clear trends start to appear
- On a daily chart: Obvious patterns and direction
- On a weekly chart: Strong long-term trends visible

**The Key Insight:**
Zoom out, and noise disappears. Zoom in, and you see detail but lose the big picture.

## Understanding Timeframe Relationships

### The Same Stock at Different Timeframes

Let's look at Apple stock on multiple timeframes:

**1-Minute Chart:**
```
Stock looks like:
[Very jagged, lots of up-down noise, hard to read]
99.50, 99.48, 99.51, 99.49, 99.52...
Direction: Unclear
Conclusion: Too noisy
```

**15-Minute Chart:**
```
Stock looks like:
[Some patterns, clearer direction visible]
99.50 → 99.75 → 99.60 → 99.85...
Direction: Slightly up
Conclusion: Clearer but still noisy
```

**1-Hour Chart:**
```
Stock looks like:
[Clear pattern, obvious direction]
99.50 → 100.20 → 100.15 → 100.40...
Direction: Clearly up
Conclusion: Professional analysis possible
```

**Daily Chart:**
```
Stock looks like:
[Crystal clear, obvious trend]
99.50 → 101.00 → 100.80 → 102.50...
Direction: Strong uptrend
Conclusion: Can't be misread
```

**Weekly Chart:**
```
Stock looks like:
[Unquestionable multi-week trend]
95.00 → 105.00 → 110.00 → 115.00...
Direction: Unmistakable uptrend
Conclusion: Everyone sees this trend
```

### The "Fractal" Nature of Markets

Markets have an interesting property: patterns repeat on every timeframe.

**Example:**
- A stock forms a "head and shoulders" pattern on a daily chart
- If you zoom in to the 1-hour chart, you see smaller head-and-shoulders patterns
- If you zoom into 5-minute charts, you see even smaller ones
- This repeating pattern structure is called a "fractal"

**Practical Implication:**
The rules of technical analysis work on every timeframe.

## Choosing the Right Timeframe

### Timeframe Selection by Trading Style

| Trading Style | Best Timeframe | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Scalper | 1-5 min | Quick in/out, many trades/day |
| Day Trader | 5-60 min | Trades finish within day |
| Swing Trader | 4H-Daily | Holds positions days/weeks |
| Position Trader | Daily-Weekly | Holds weeks/months |
| Investor | Weekly-Monthly | Years-long positions |

### Timeframe Selection by Skill Level

**Beginners:** Start with daily charts
- Clear patterns
- Less noise
- Easy to learn on
- Reduces emotional stress

**Intermediate:** Use 4-hour and daily
- Good balance
- Useful patterns
- Professional standard
- Manageable trade frequency

**Advanced:** Use multiple timeframes
- See full picture
- Confirm signals
- Professional approach

### The 3-Timeframe Approach (Professional Standard)

Many professional traders use THREE timeframes together:

**Example Setup:**
1. **Weekly chart** (decide DIRECTION) - Am I looking to buy or sell?
2. **Daily chart** (find ENTRY) - Where exactly do I enter?
3. **1-hour chart** (manage TRADE) - Where do I exit if wrong?

**How it works:**

**Step 1 - Weekly (What's the Trend?)**
```
Weekly chart shows: Strong uptrend
Conclusion: Look for BUYING opportunities only
```

**Step 2 - Daily (Where to Enter?)**
```
Daily chart shows: Dip to support after pullback
Conclusion: This is a GOOD buying point
Entry price: $100
```

**Step 3 - 1-hour (When to Exit?)**
```
1-hour chart shows: Support breaks at $98
Conclusion: Set stop loss at $97.50
If price hits $97.50, exit the trade
```

**Result:** Professional trade setup using three timeframes.

## Practical Timeframe Rules

### Rule 1: Match Timeframe to Your Schedule

**If you trade daily (during work):**
- Use 4-hour or daily charts
- Trades don't need baby-sitting
- Check once before market close

**If you're available all day:**
- Use 1-hour to 4-hour charts
- Can monitor actively
- More trading opportunities

**If you check once per week:**
- Use weekly or daily charts
- Long-term positions
- Less stress

### Rule 2: Lower Timeframes = More Signals (and More Noise)

**1-minute chart:** 100+ signals per day (mostly false)
**1-hour chart:** 5-6 signals per day (some false)
**Daily chart:** 3-5 signals per week (fewer false signals)
**Weekly chart:** 2-3 signals per month (most reliable)

**General Principle:**
- Shorter timeframes = More trades but lower win rate
- Longer timeframes = Fewer trades but higher win rate

### Rule 3: Never Trade Against the Larger Timeframe

This is CRITICAL for success.

**Example - The Wrong Way:**
```
Weekly chart: Downtrend (selling signal)
1-hour chart: Small uptrend (buying signal)
Your decision: Buy based on 1-hour chart

Result: You buy into a downtrend = High chance of loss
```

**Example - The Right Way:**
```
Weekly chart: Uptrend (buying signal) ← Start here
1-hour chart: Small dip to support (buying signal) ← Confirm here
Your decision: Buy

Result: Buying direction matches both timeframes = Better odds
```

### Rule 4: Confirm Signals Across Timeframes

**Multi-Timeframe Confirmation:**

When signals align across multiple timeframes, the trade is stronger.

```
Daily chart shows: Break above resistance ← Green light
4-hour chart shows: Break above resistance ← Green light
1-hour chart shows: Break above resistance ← Green light

Result: Three timeframes agree = Strong signal
Probability of success: Much higher
```

## Real-World Application

### Scenario 1: The Confused Trader

**Situation:**
You look at Tesla (TSLA) on a 1-minute chart. It looks like it's going down. You sell.

**Problem:**
On the 1-hour chart, it's clearly going UP. You're fighting the main trend.

**Solution:**
Always check the daily chart first. Only use shorter timeframes for timing entries into the main trend.

### Scenario 2: Too Many Signals

**Situation:**
You trade 5-minute charts. You get 50+ trading signals per day. You're exhausted.

**Problem:**
Too many signals = Too much work = Emotional decision-making = Losses

**Solution:**
Move to 1-hour or daily charts. Fewer signals = Better trading.

### Scenario 3: Missing Big Moves

**Situation:**
You only look at daily charts. You miss a 20% move that takes 4 days.

**Problem:**
You're not catching moves that take multiple days.

**Solution:**
Use 4-hour chart to catch moves within the daily trend.

### Scenario 4: The Three-Timeframe Trade

**Your Setup:**

**Market Observation:**
Apple (AAPL) looks interesting. You want to find an entry.

**Step 1 - Check Weekly Chart:**
```
Trend: Strong uptrend (buyers in control long-term)
Conclusion: YES, this is a buying stock
```

**Step 2 - Check Daily Chart:**
```
Pattern: Stock pulled back to support after rise
Support level: $150
Conclusion: This is a good entry point to buy
```

**Step 3 - Check 1-Hour Chart:**
```
Pattern: Stock is consolidating at support
Entry price: $150.50
Stop loss: $149.50 (just below support)
Target: $155 (next resistance)
```

**Your Trade:**
- Buy 50 shares at $150.50
- Stop loss at $149.50 (risk $50)
- Target $155 (profit $225)
- Risk/reward ratio: 1:4.5 (excellent)

This professional setup uses three timeframes and follows market structure.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Trading Intraday Movements Against the Daily Trend

**Reality:** If daily is downtrend, a 1-hour uptrend is just a bounce. Don't fight the main trend.

### Mistake #2: Using Only One Timeframe

**Reality:** Professional traders always use multiple timeframes. One view is incomplete.

### Mistake #3: Choosing Timeframe Based on Impatience

**What Traders Do Wrong:**
"I want to make a quick profit, so I'll use 1-minute charts."

**Why It's Wrong:**
Shorter timeframes have more noise and lower win rates.

**The Right Way:**
Choose timeframe based on your actual schedule and patience, not greed.

### Mistake #4: Confusing Timeframe Signals

**Reality:** A 5-minute chart breakout doesn't matter if the daily chart is in downtrend. Check larger timeframes first.

### Mistake #5: Not Adjusting Stop Loss Distance by Timeframe

**Reality:** On a 1-minute chart, you might use a $0.50 stop. On a daily chart, a $5 stop is more appropriate.
