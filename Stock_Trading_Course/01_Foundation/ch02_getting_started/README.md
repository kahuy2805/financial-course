## Common Questions About Chapter 2

**Q: Do I need to open a real brokerage account to complete this chapter?**
A: No! All lessons and most exercises can be completed with just research. Paper trading (free simulation) is recommended. Real trading is optional.

**Q: How much money do I need to start?**
A: Technically just $1 with some brokers that offer fractional shares. Practically, $100-500 is a good starting amount to avoid overthinking. You're learning, not making a fortune on first trade.

**Q: Should I choose market orders or limit orders for my first trade?**
A: Market orders are simpler for first trades with liquid stocks. Limit orders are great once you're comfortable. Start simple, advance later.

**Q: Will I lose money on trading costs?**
A: Spreads cost a tiny bit (pennies usually). If you're trading $1,000 positions, spread costs $1-5. Not a major factor for buy-and-hold investors but matters for active traders.

**Q: Can I skip the exercises?**
A: The more you practice, the better. At minimum, do the paper trading exercise. It's risk-free and builds real confidence.
