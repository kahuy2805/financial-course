# Lesson 13.1: Strategic Asset Allocation

## Overview
Asset allocation is the foundational strategy that determines your portfolio's risk and return profile. Rather than picking individual stocks, you're deciding what percentage of your capital goes to different asset classes.

## Key Concepts

### The Three Core Pillars
1. **Stocks (Equities)**
   - Growth potential
   - Higher volatility
   - Dividends and capital appreciation

2. **Bonds (Fixed Income)**
   - Stability and income
   - Lower volatility
   - Capital preservation

3. **Cash and Alternatives**
   - Liquidity
   - Emergency reserves
   - Diversification hedge

## Allocation Frameworks

### Classic Age-Based Model
```
Stock Allocation % = 100 - Your Age
or (Conservative) = 80 - Your Age

Examples:
- Age 25: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Age 40: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Age 55: 45% stocks, 55% bonds
- Age 70: 30% stocks, 70% bonds
```

### Modern 3-Fund Portfolio
```
Conservative:    30% Stocks / 60% Bonds / 10% Alternatives
Moderate:        60% Stocks / 35% Bonds / 5% Alternatives
Aggressive:      85% Stocks / 10% Bonds / 5% Alternatives
Growth-focused:  90% Stocks / 5% Bonds / 5% Cash
```

### Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)
Adjust allocations based on:
- Economic cycle stage
- Interest rate environment
- Market valuations
- Sector strength
- Momentum indicators

**Example TAA Adjustment:**
- Bull market, low rates: Increase stocks to 80%
- Rising rates environment: Increase bonds to 50%
- Recession warning: Move to 40/40/20 defensive

## Risk Tolerance Assessment

### Portfolio Risk Profile
```
Your Allocation = f(Time Horizon, Risk Tolerance, Income Needs, Goals)
```

**High Risk Tolerance:**
- Can handle 30-40% drawdowns
- Long time horizon (10+ years)
- Stable income source
- No immediate capital needs

**Medium Risk Tolerance:**
- Can handle 15-25% drawdowns
- Medium time horizon (5-10 years)
- Moderate income needs
- Some upcoming capital needs

**Low Risk Tolerance:**
- Can only handle 5-10% drawdowns
- Short time horizon (under 5 years)
- Income-dependent
- Frequent capital withdrawals
```

## Diversification Beyond Asset Classes

### Sector Allocation (Stocks)
```
Technology:     20-25%
Healthcare:     15-20%
Financials:     12-15%
Industrials:    10-12%
Energy:         5-8%
Utilities:      5-7%
Consumer:       10-12%
Other:          10-15%
```

### Geographic Diversification
```
US Large-Cap:      45-55%
US Small/Mid-Cap:  10-15%
International Dev: 15-20%
Emerging Markets:  5-10%
Bonds (Various):   20-35%
```

### Stock Style Diversification
```
Large-cap Value:    20%
Large-cap Growth:   15%
Mid-cap Value:      8%
Mid-cap Growth:     8%
Small-cap Value:    5%
Small-cap Growth:   5%
```

## Common Allocation Mistakes

### 1. Over-concentration
**Problem:** 80% in one sector or stock
**Solution:** Maintain maximum 15% in any single position

### 2. Emotional Allocation
**Problem:** Chasing recent winners
**Solution:** Use systematic, data-driven allocation

### 3. Neglecting Bonds
**Problem:** "I'm young, bonds are boring"
**Solution:** Bonds reduce drawdowns and provide rebalancing funds

### 4. Static Allocation
**Problem:** Never adjusting as life changes
**Solution:** Review and adjust annually or at major life events

### 5. Excessive Complexity
**Problem:** 50+ different holdings with no clear strategy
**Solution:** Keep it simple—20-30 holdings maximum

## Rebalancing Triggers

Set predetermined times to rebalance:
- **Calendar:** Annually or quarterly
- **Threshold:** When any allocation drifts >5% from target
- **Major Event:** Job change, inheritance, market crash

## Key Takeaways

1. **Asset allocation is the #1 determinant of risk/return** (90% of portfolio variance)
2. **Diversification reduces unsystematic risk** without sacrificing returns
3. **Your allocation should match your life stage and goals**
4. **Simple is better than complex** (3-5 core positions beat 50 mediocre ones)
5. **Stick with your allocation** through market cycles
6. **Rebalance systematically** to lock in gains and buy dips

## Next Steps

- [ ] Assess your risk tolerance honestly
- [ ] Choose your target allocation
- [ ] List the specific holdings
- [ ] Schedule first purchase
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for annual review
