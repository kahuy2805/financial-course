# Lesson 13.2: Portfolio Rebalancing Strategies

## Overview
Rebalancing is the disciplined practice of realigning your portfolio back to target allocations. It forces you to "buy low and sell high" systematically—the cornerstone of successful investing.

## Why Rebalancing Matters

### The Drift Problem
```
Target Allocation:     Actual After 1 Year Growth:
60% Stocks              70% (stocks grew more)
40% Bonds               30% (bonds grew less)
                       Problem: Now too risky!
```

### Benefits of Rebalancing
1. **Risk Management:** Prevents portfolio from becoming too concentrated
2. **Systematic Trading:** Removes emotion from buying/selling
3. **Tax-Advantaged:** Can harvest losses, defer gains
4. **Enhanced Returns:** Studies show 0.5-1% annual benefit
5. **Peace of Mind:** Maintains your chosen risk profile

## Rebalancing Timing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Calendar-Based (Simplest)
**Rebalance on a fixed schedule:**
- **Annual:** Most common, minimal trading costs
- **Semi-annual:** Moderate adjustment frequency
- **Quarterly:** More active monitoring

**Pros:**
- Discipline and consistency
- Easy to remember
- Low transaction costs

**Cons:**
- May miss major market moves
- Arbitrary timing

**Implementation:**
```
Reminder: January 1st annually
Steps:
1. Calculate current allocation %
2. Identify drift from target
3. Execute trades to realign
4. Document for tax purposes
```

### Strategy 2: Threshold-Based (More Active)
**Rebalance when allocation drifts >threshold:**

**Typical Thresholds:**
```
Conservative Portfolio:    Drift >3% from target
Moderate Portfolio:        Drift >5% from target
Aggressive Portfolio:      Drift >7% from target
Trading Portfolio:         Drift >10% from target
```

**Example:**
```
Target: 60% Stocks / 40% Bonds
Current: 68% Stocks / 32% Bonds
Drift: 8% (exceeds 5% threshold)
Action: Rebalance

Sell: $10,000 of stocks
Buy: $10,000 of bonds
Result: Back to 60/40
```

**Pros:**
- Responds to market moves
- Prevents excessive drift
- Captures larger opportunities

**Cons:**
- Requires frequent monitoring
- More trading costs
- Higher tax consequences

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Combine calendar + threshold:**

```
Primary: Rebalance annually (January)
Secondary: Rebalance if drift exceeds 7%
Tertiary: Rebalance with new contributions

This balances discipline with flexibility
```

## Rebalancing Methods

### Method 1: Dollar Rebalancing (Simplest)
**Use new contributions to rebalance:**

```
Situation:
Current Portfolio Value: $100,000
Target Allocation:     60% Stocks / 40% Bonds
Current Allocation:    70% Stocks / 30% Bonds (drifted)

New Contribution: $5,000

Solution: Invest all $5,000 in bonds
Result:   Portfolio naturally rebalances toward target
```

**Advantages:**
- No selling needed
- Minimal taxes
- Minimal transaction costs

**Use When:**
- Making regular contributions
- Portfolio is young
- Drift is minor

### Method 2: Rebalancing Through Dividends/Interest
**Redirect income to rebalance:**

```
Quarterly Dividend from Stocks: $1,500
Quarterly Bond Interest: $500

Current Allocation: Too much in stocks

Solution: Invest all $1,500 dividend in bonds
          Skip reinvesting bond interest (use elsewhere)
Result:   Natural rebalancing without trading
```

### Method 3: Tax-Loss Harvesting Rebalancing
**Sell losing positions to rebalance + capture losses:**

```
Situation:
Apple (Stocks):  Down 15%, currently $5,000 worth
Bonds:          At target level

Action:
1. Sell Apple position: Capture $750 loss
2. Buy different stock or stock ETF: Maintain stock allocation
3. Deduct loss against gains: Tax benefit

Result: Rebalanced + Tax advantaged
```

### Method 4: Direct Rebalancing
**Sell overweight positions, buy underweight positions:**

```
Target: 60/40, Current: 70/30, Portfolio: $100,000

Overweight stocks by $10,000
Underweight bonds by $10,000

Action:
- Sell $10,000 of stocks
- Buy $10,000 of bonds

Cost considerations:
- Commission: $0-10 (most brokers)
- Bid-ask spread: 0.01-0.05%
- Tax impact: Check for short-term gains
```

## Tax-Efficient Rebalancing

### Strategy: Rebalance in Tax-Deferred Accounts First
```
Account Priority for Rebalancing:
1. Traditional IRA (tax-free rebalancing)
2. 401(k) (tax-free rebalancing)
3. Roth IRA (tax-free rebalancing)
4. HSA (tax-free rebalancing)
5. Taxable Account (tax consequences)

By rebalancing tax-deferred accounts first,
you minimize taxable events
```

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Rebalancing
**Example:**

```
Position A (Stock ETF):    $50,000 original, worth $45,000 (-$5,000)
Position B (Bond ETF):     $50,000 original, worth $55,000 (+$5,000)
Total Portfolio:           $100,000

Problem: 55% in bonds (too much), 45% in stocks (too little)
Goal: Return to 50/50

Tax-Free Solution:
1. Sell Position A at loss:          -$5,000 loss (harvest)
2. Buy different stock position:     Replace with $45,000
3. Sell Position B at gain:          $5,000 gain
4. Buy bonds (different issuer):     Replace with $50,000

Net Tax Impact:
- Capital gains:  $5,000
- Capital losses: $5,000
- Net:           $0 (loss offsets gain)

Plus: $5,000 in cash freed up (use for distributions/taxes)
```

### Wash Sale Considerations
```
Wash Sale Rule: Can't deduct loss if you buy
substantially identical security within 30 days
before or after the sale

Solution:
- Use different ETF (VTI vs VOO both track similar)
- Use different sector fund
- Wait 31+ days

Example of Wash Sale Avoidance:
SOLD Apple at loss (in taxable account)
CAN'T BUY:    Apple stock within 30 days
CAN BUY:      Different tech stock or ETF
              Apple in retirement account (different account)
```

## Rebalancing Frequency Analysis

### Low Frequency (Annual)
**Allocation:** Conservative portfolios
**Cost:** Very low trading
**Tax Impact:** Minimal
**Discipline Impact:** High (locked-in process)

### Medium Frequency (Quarterly)
**Allocation:** Moderate portfolios
**Cost:** 4 trades/year + costs
**Tax Impact:** Moderate
**Discipline Impact:** Good

### High Frequency (Monthly)
**Allocation:** Active traders only
**Cost:** 12+ trades/year (expensive!)
**Tax Impact:** High
**Tax Impact:** May reduce returns below buy-hold

### Research Finding
Studies show: **Annual rebalancing outperforms monthly** for most investors
- Higher trading costs erode returns
- Greater tax consequences
- Emotional triggers increase bad decisions

## Common Rebalancing Mistakes

### 1. Over-Trading
**Problem:** Rebalancing monthly when drift is only 2%
**Cost:** Excessive commissions and taxes
**Solution:** Set minimum 5% drift threshold

### 2. Rebalancing in Taxable Accounts Only
**Problem:** Triggering capital gains taxes
**Solution:** Rebalance tax-deferred accounts first

### 3. Rebalancing During Market Extremes
**Problem:** Panic selling during crashes (missing recovery)
**Solution:** Stick to disciplined schedule

### 4. Ignoring Transaction Costs
**Problem:** "I'll rebalance every month" (ignores fees)
**Cost:** 0.5-1% annual drag from trading costs
**Solution:** Calculate costs before deciding frequency

### 5. Not Rebalancing at All
**Problem:** "It's too complicated" or "I'll do it later"
**Result:** Portfolio drift makes it riskier
**Solution:** Automate the process

## Rebalancing Automation

### Brokerage Tools
- **Most brokers offer:** Automatic rebalancing services
- **Cost:** Usually free
