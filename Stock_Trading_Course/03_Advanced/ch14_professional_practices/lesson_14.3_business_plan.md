# Lesson 14.3: Building Your Trading Business Plan

## Overview
Most traders are hobbyists with no plan. Professional traders have documented businesses. A business plan transforms trading from gambling into an enterprise with defined objectives, strategies, and metrics. It's the difference between "I hope I make money" and "Here's exactly how I'll make money."

## Why You Need a Business Plan

### The Difference

**Without a Plan (Hobbyist):**
```
"I'm going to make money trading stocks"
- No defined strategy
- Trades based on gut feeling
- No risk management
- Returns vary wildly (+50% one month, -30% next)
- Frequently changes approach
- No documentation
- Average result: Break-even or slight loss
- Tax complications (is this business or hobby?)
```

**With a Plan (Professional):**
```
"I execute 15-25 swing trades monthly, targeting 2-3% per trade,
risking 1% per trade, holding 3-10 days, using price action +
volume analysis. Expected return: 10-15%/year. I track every trade,
measure Sharpe ratio, and adjust only when tested system fails."

- Defined, testable strategy
- Consistent entry/exit rules
- Strict risk management
- Predictable performance
- Evolution based on data, not emotion
- Full documentation
- Professional tax treatment
- Average result: Consistent profitability
```

**Position Sizing:**
```
My Position Sizing Rules:

Account Risk Rule:
Risk per trade: 1% of account maximum
Example: $10,000 account → Risk $100 per trade

Position Size Calculation:
Entry price: $________
Stop loss price: $________
Loss per share: Entry - Stop = $______
Risk per trade: $100 (your 1%)
Position size: $100 / $______ per share = ______ shares

Formula for any trade:
Number of shares = (Account size × 0.01) / (Entry - Stop)

Examples:
$5,000 account, $50 entry, $49 stop = 5 shares
$20,000 account, $100 entry, $98 stop = 100 shares
$100,000 account, $200 entry, $195 stop = 200 shares

This ensures my risk is consistent regardless of stock price

## Business Structure Decision

### Sole Proprietor vs. LLC vs. S-Corp

```
SOLE PROPRIETOR:
Structure: Your personal business (simplest)
Tax treatment: Personal tax return (Schedule C)
Self-employment tax: Full 15.3%
Liability: Personal—all business liability is your liability
Cost: Minimal ($0-100)
Good for: Part-time traders, low income ($30k-50k)
Tax paid: Annual

LLC (Limited Liability Company):
Structure: Business entity separate from you
Tax treatment: Pass-through (Schedule C or corporate)
Self-employment tax: Can be reduced with S-election
Liability: Protected (business issues don't become personal)
Cost: Setup $500-2,000, annual $300-1,000
Good for: Full-time traders, growing business
Tax advantage: Slight over sole proprietor

S-CORP:
Structure: Corporation with special tax election
Tax treatment: Corporate with S-election
Self-employment tax: Can be significantly reduced
  (Take salary: $50,000 + distributions $30,000)
  (Only salary subjects to SE tax, not all distributions)
Liability: Maximum protection
Cost: Setup $1,500-3,000, annual filing $500-2,000, accounting $2,000-4,000
Good for: Successful full-time traders earning $100k+
Tax savings: Can be $5,000-15,000+/year

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

Annual trading income < $50,000:
→ Sole proprietor (simplest, lowest cost)

Annual trading income $50,000-100,000:
→ LLC (some liability protection, minimal complexity)

Annual trading income > $100,000:
→ S-Corp (tax savings exceed accounting costs)

If you're unsure: Start with sole proprietor, migrate to LLC as income grows
```
