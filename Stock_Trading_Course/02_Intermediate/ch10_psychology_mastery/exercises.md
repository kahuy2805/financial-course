If yes, I will implement these systems:

□ Criteria strictness filter (higher standards after losses)
□ Position sizing lock (cannot increase after losses)

```

**Part 2: Implement Four Prevention Systems**

System 1: Loss Timeout
```
LOSS TIMEOUT IMPLEMENTATION

I commit to this: □ Yes  □ No
```

System 3: Position Sizing Lock

After every loss, I will read this pledge:

"I took a loss today. My brain wants to:

I will NOT do any of these.
Instead I will:
□ Take a 2+ hour break
□ Review the loss in my journal
□ Wait for a HIGHEST probability setup
□ Trust my system, not my emotions

This loss is information, not failure.
My system still works. One loss doesn't prove it's broken.
I will have many more losses. This is one of them.
I will stay disciplined.

Date: ________  Time: ________"

Signed: ________________
```

## Your Progress So Far

You've now mastered:

**Chapter 5 (Foundation):**

2. **Implement all systems** in your daily trading
3. **Track your progress** weekly and monthly
4. **Refine based on experience** - your psychology plan will evolve
5. **Maintain consistency** - these are lifelong practices, not temporary fixes

Trading psychology isn't something you "finish." It's something you practice daily for your entire trading career.

The traders with the best long-term results:
- Continuously work on their psychology
- Have detailed routines they follow religiously
- Maintain stress management practices indefinitely
- Review and refine their systems regularly
- Accept that trading is a psychological challenge as much as a technical one

You've built the foundation. Now it's about executing it consistently, day after day, month after month, year after year.

The profits follow the psychology. Master the psychology, and the profits take care of themselves.

Progress to Chapter 11 when all exercises are complete and you've demonstrated commitment to your psychology mastery plan.
