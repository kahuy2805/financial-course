# Lesson 8.6: Pullback and Retracement Trading

## Learning Objectives
- Identify pullback trading setups in established trends
- Apply retracement levels (Fibonacci and percentage)
- Distinguish between pullbacks and reversals
- Trade support bounces with proper risk management

## What is a Pullback?

A pullback is a temporary price reversal against the main trend before resuming in the original direction.

### Key Characteristics
- **Definition**: Small move against trend within larger directional move
- **Duration**: 2-5 days typically
- **Size**: 20%-50% retracement of recent advance
- **Context**: Occurs within established uptrend or downtrend
- **Opportunity**: Lower-risk entry in direction of main trend
- **Holding Period**: 3-10 days

## Pullback vs. Reversal

### How to Distinguish

```
PULLBACK (We want these):
- Price pulls back in established uptrend
- Original uptrend direction still valid
- Support holds (higher low maintained)
- Quick reversal back up
- Lower volume on down days

REVERSAL (Avoid these):
- Trend changes direction
- Support broken conclusively
- Multiple lower lows forming
- No bounce from support level
- Volume increasing on breakdowns
```

### Visual Comparison

```
Pullback Pattern:
    ↑ (uptrend continues)
   / \    ← Pullback (small dip)
  /   \
 /     \ ← Higher low (support holds)
_______

Reversal Pattern:
   /  \
  /    \  ← Fails to bounce
 /      \
_________
    ↓ (Now downtrend begins)
```

## Retracement Levels

### Fibonacci Retracement Levels

```
Golden ratio in finance: 0.618 (61.8%)

Standard Fibonacci Retracement Levels:
- 23.6% retracement: Shallow pullback
- 38.2% retracement: Normal pullback
- 50.0% retracement: Mid-point (not Fibonacci, but significant)
- 61.8% retracement: Deep pullback (approaching reversal)
- 78.6% retracement: Very deep (likely reversal, not pullback)

Application:
- Measure from recent swing high to swing low
- Project retracement levels
- Use as entry points
- Bounce off levels = continuation signal
```

### Fibonacci Example

```
Recent uptrend measured:
- Swing low: $100
- Swing high: $130
- Move distance: $30

Retracement calculations:
- 23.6% retracement: $130 - ($30 × 0.236) = $122.92
- 38.2% retracement: $130 - ($30 × 0.382) = $118.54
- 50.0% retracement: $130 - ($30 × 0.50) = $115.00
- 61.8% retracement: $130 - ($30 × 0.618) = $111.46
- 78.6% retracement: $130 - ($30 × 0.786) = $106.42

Pullback trading entry zones:
- STRONG pullback entry: $122.92 (23.6%)
- NORMAL pullback entry: $118.54 (38.2%)
- DEEP pullback entry: $115.00 (50.0%)
- REVERSAL risk: Below $111.46 (61.8%+)
```

### Percentage Retracement

Simplified alternative to Fibonacci:

```
Recent move: $100 → $150 (25% gain)

Retracement levels:
- 25% pullback: $150 - (25% of $50) = $137.50
- 33% pullback: $150 - (33% of $50) = $133.33
- 50% pullback: $150 - (50% of $50) = $125.00
- 67% pullback: $150 - (67% of $50) = $116.50

Pullback trading:
- Light pullback (25%): Aggressive entry
- Normal pullback (33-50%): Best entry
- Deep pullback (67%+): Reversal risk high
```

## Pullback Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Fibonacci Bounce Trade

**The Setup:**
```
Uptrend identified:
- Price in strong uptrend (higher lows, higher highs)
- Recent move: $200 → $240
- Pullback begins

Fibonacci Analysis:
- Entry target: 38.2% retracement = $224.80
- Stop loss: 61.8% retracement = $215.20
- Target: New high above $240

Position Sizing:
- Risk per trade: $300 (1.5%)
- Stop loss distance: $224.80 - $215.20 = $9.60
- Position size: $300 / $9.60 = 31 shares
- Entry capital: 31 × $224.80 = $6,969
```

**Example with Real Stock:**

```
Stock: Netflix (NFLX)
- Low: $320.00
- High: $420.00
- Recent pullback begins

Fibonacci Levels:
- 23.6%: $393.16 (shallow pullback)
- 38.2%: $361.96 (normal pullback)
- 50.0%: $370.00 (mid-point)
- 61.8%: $338.04 (deep pullback/reversal risk)

Trade Setup:
- Entry: $362.00 (near 38.2% Fib level)
- Position: 50 shares
- Stop Loss: $335.00 (-$1,350)
- Target 1: $400.00 (new high area)
- Target 2: $430.00 (extension)

Risk: $1,350 (6.75% on $20K - reduce position!)
Better sizing: 25 shares = $675 risk (3.4%)

Rationale: Fibonacci level provides technical support
```

### Strategy 2: Moving Average Pullback Trade

**The Setup:**
```
Uptrend confirmed:
- Price > 50-day MA (confirms uptrend)
- Price pulls back toward 50-day MA
- 50-day MA acts as dynamic support

Position:
- Entry: On bounce from 50-day MA
- Stop Loss: Below 50-day MA and recent swing low
- Target: New high
- Hold: 5-10 days
```

**Example:**

```
Stock: Microsoft (MSFT)
- 50-day MA: $350.00
- Recent high: $365.00
- Current price: $352.00 (pullback toward MA)
- Support confluence: Previous swing low at $349.00

Setup:
- Entry: $350.50 (bounce from 50-day MA)
- Position: 30 shares
- Stop Loss: $348.00 (-$75)
- Target 1: $360.00 (+$285)
- Target 2: $370.00 (+$585)

Risk: $75 (0.375% on $20K)
Reward: $285-$585 (1.4%-2.9%)
Risk-Reward: 1:3.8 to 1:7.8 (excellent)
```

### Strategy 3: Support Confluence Pullback

**Multiple Support Levels Align:**

```
Identifying Confluence:
1. Recent swing low: $148.00
2. 20-day MA: $147.50
3. Fibonacci 38.2%: $147.80
4. Previous minor support: $148.00

All levels cluster = HIGH PROBABILITY SUPPORT

Setup:
- Stock pulling back from $165 high
- Approaches support cluster at $148
- Entry: $148.00 (at confluence)
- Stop Loss: $145.00 (below all levels)
- Position: 40 shares
- Target: $160.00 (+$480)

Trade Plan:
- Day 1: Stock near $152 (approaching support)
- Day 2: Test support at $148.10, entry triggered
- Day 3-5: Bounce from support, moving higher
- Day 6-8: Reach target at $160, exit
```

```

## Pullback Trading with Volume Analysis

### Volume Confirmation

```
Healthy pullback (support will hold):
- Up days: High volume
- Down days (pullback): Low volume
- Ratio: Down volume < Up volume
- Interpretation: Selling pressure light, bullish

Unhealthy pullback (reversal risk):
- Up days: Normal volume
- Down days (pullback): High volume
- Ratio: Down volume > Up volume
- Interpretation: Heavy selling, reversal risk

Example:
Stock up $100 → $120 average volume 2M

Day 1 pullback: $118, volume 1.2M (light) → GOOD
Day 2 pullback: $116, volume 2.8M (heavy) → WARNING
Day 3 pullback: $114, volume 3.1M (heavy) → AVOID, reversal likely
```

## Pullback Timing: When to Enter

### Good Times to Enter Pullbacks

```
1. Early morning (9:30-10:00 AM)
   - Fresh data, cleaner technical picture
   - Avoid opening volatility
   - Best setup clarity

2. Mid-day dip (11:30 AM-2:00 PM)
   - Volume typically lower (time decay)
   - Good for second pullback entry
   - Less institutional noise

3. Multi-day pullback (not intraday)
   - 2-3 day move down in larger uptrend
   - Better risk-reward
   - Less whipsaw
```

### Bad Times to Enter Pullbacks

```
1. Right at market open
   - High slippage
   - Gap reversals common
   - Avoid first 30 minutes

2. Late afternoon (last hour)
   - End-of-day reversals
   - Overnight gap risk
   - Poor execution

3. Extreme pullbacks (>50%)
   - May be reversal, not pullback
   - Fib level exceeded
   - Too much risk on entry
```

## Pullback Trading Rules

### Hard Rules

1. **Trend must be established**
   - Price above 50-day MA minimum
   - Multiple higher lows visible
   - Uptrend = longer than pullback

2. **Entry at support confluence**
   - Fibonacci level AND moving average
   - OR multiple support levels
   - Never arbitrary pullback entry

3. **Volume confirms support**
   - Down volume < Up volume
   - Light volume on pullback day
   - Increase on bounce confirmation

4. **Stop loss below support cluster**
   - Not tight, but at logical level
   - 1.5-2% of account maximum
   - Accept loss if support breaks

5. **Target is new high area**
   - Minimum: Previous pullback high
   - Better: New all-time high
   - Scale out on resistance

### Risk Management

```
Position Sizing Rule:
- Risk per trade: 1-1.5%
- Stop loss distance: Varies by stock
- Position size: (Risk Amount / Stop Distance) = Shares

Example calculation:
- Account: $20,000
- Risk: 1% = $200
- Stop distance: $4 per share
- Position: $200 / $4 = 50 shares
- Entry capital: 50 × $market price
```

## Common Pullback Trading Mistakes

1. **No confirmed trend**
   - Problem: Entering pullback in sideways market
   - Result: Pullback becomes reversal
   - Solution: Price must be > 50-day MA first

2. **Averaging down**
   - Problem: Adding shares as price drops further
   - Result: Stop loss doubles down on loss
   - Solution: Pre-defined position size only

3. **Over-holding**
   - Problem: Waiting for absolute target
   - Result: Trend reverses, giving back profits
   - Solution: Exit on resistance, don't overstay

4. **High-volume pullback**
   - Problem: Entering on heavy down volume
   - Result: Support breaks, reversal confirmed
   - Solution: Light volume requirement for pullback

5. **Pullback too deep**
   - Problem: Entering after 61.8%+ retracement
   - Result: Actually a reversal, not pullback
   - Solution: Stay above 50% max for pullback trades

## Summary

Pullback trading enters established trends at support:
- Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%) provide entry targets
- Moving averages act as dynamic support
- Support confluence increases probability
- Light volume on pullback = healthy continuation
- Scale out on resistance targets

Key advantage: Lower-risk entries in direction of main trend.

## Key Takeaways

1. Pullback occurs within established uptrend/downtrend
2. Fibonacci 38.2% retracement is most common pullback target
3. Entry on bounce from support, not continued selling
4. Stop loss below support cluster (multiple levels)
5. Light volume during pullback is bullish sign
6. Target is previous high or new high beyond
7. Hold 3-10 days while pullback resolves
8. Scale out 1/3-1/3-1/3 on targets

## Next Steps

- Chart study: Identify 5 pullbacks in established trends
- Calculate Fibonacci retracement levels
- Practice entries at 38.2% and 50% levels
- Monitor volume during pullback development
- Track pullback success rate vs. reversal failure rate
