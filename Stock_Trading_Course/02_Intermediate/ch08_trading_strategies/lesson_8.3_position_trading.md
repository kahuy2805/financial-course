## Position Trading vs. Investing

```
Position Trading:
- Entry: Technical setup + trend
- Hold: Follow predetermined trade plan

- Cash reserve: $0-3,000
- Expected hold: 16 weeks average
```

### Scaling Into Positions Strategy

Rather than buying entire position at once:

```
Stock: NVDA showing weekly breakout setup
Plan: Build 120-share position
Target allocation: $12,000 (48% of $25K account)

Scale-in plan:

Purchase 1 (Week 1): 40 shares at $850.00 = $34,000
- Confirmation of break
- 1/3 of final position

Purchase 2 (Week 4): 40 shares at $865.00 = $34,600
- Second signal, holding above breakout
- 2/3 of position

Purchase 3 (Week 8): 40 shares at $878.00 = $35,120
- Final breakout confirmation
- Complete 3/3 position

Average entry: $864.33 for 120 shares
Total cost: $103,720
Effective stop: $800.00 (only adjusted after first 50% gain)

Benefits:
- Reduced risk on false breakouts
- Lower average entry than catching top of breakout
- Pyramid works in both directions
```

## Weekly Chart Checklist

Before entering a position trade, verify:

```
Technical Setup:
☐ Weekly chart shows clear pattern (breakout/reversal)
☐ Price above or at key moving average
☐ Volume confirms move (increasing on breakout)
☐ Risk-reward minimum 1:2 ratio

Momentum:
☐ RSI not at extreme (below 70 on entry)
☐ MACD shows bullish alignment
☐ Price making higher lows (uptrend)

Timeframe:
☐ Previous consolidation 8+ weeks (establishes level)
☐ Breakout at weekly close, not intraweek spike
☐ Can commit to 4-6 week hold minimum

Position Sizing:
☐ Stop loss calculated at logical level
☐ Position size limits risk to 2-3%
☐ Total portfolio risk under 10%
☐ Cash reserve maintained for opportunities

Exit Plan:
☐ Target 1 set at breakout height
☐ Target 2 set at 2x breakout height
☐ Profit-taking plan: 1/3-1/3-1/3
☐ Stop loss placed before entry
```

## Common Position Trading Mistakes

1. **Averaging down losing positions**: Violates risk management
2. **Holding too long**: Past the trade's natural exit
3. **Ignoring weekly trend**: Taking trades against the trend
4. **Positions too large**: Can't sleep at night = risk too high
5. **Not scaling out winners**: All-or-nothing mentality
6. **Picking bottoms**: Trying to catch the exact low
7. **Revenge trading**: Adding to positions after stops
8. **No exit plan**: Only planning entry, not exit

## Position Trading Psychology

### Challenges
- **Uncertainty**: Holding 20-week trades requires patience
- **Opportunity cost**: Cash sitting while market moves
- **FOMO**: Missing short-term moves on other stocks
- **Drawdowns**: Seeing position down 5-8% requires discipline

### Solutions
- Keep trading journal to track performance
- Remember historical win rates
- Focus on high-quality setups only
- Manage position size to sleep well

## Summary

Position trading captures major moves (10%-30%+) using:
- Weekly and monthly chart analysis
- Large consolidation breakouts and reversals
- Moving average trend confirmation
- Scaling into positions over 4-8 weeks
- 2-3% risk per position with multi-week holds

Key advantage: Requires less daily attention than swing trading.

## Key Takeaways

1. Weekly charts provide the best trend clarity for position trades
2. Consolidations of 8+ weeks create high-probability breakouts
3. Scale into positions over multiple weeks, not all at once
4. Position size inversely related to stop loss distance
5. Use 1/3-1/3-1/3 profit-taking on weekly targets
6. Hold 12-24 weeks (4-6 months typically)
7. Weekly trend change = immediate exit signal
8. Portfolio maximum 10% risk across all position trades

## Next Steps

- Study weekly charts: Find 3 consolidation patterns
- Identify major support/resistance on weekly
- Plan position trade with 1:2 minimum risk-reward
- Build position scaling plan over 4-6 weeks
- Create trading journal for position tracking
