## Overview

While technical analysis shows you WHAT is happening with price, fundamental analysis tells you WHY it's happening. Master fundamental analysis and you'll understand the true value of a company - whether a stock is cheap or expensive, whether it's a good investment or a risky bet. This is the tool that separates value investors from day traders.

**Time to complete:** 25-30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapter 6: Technical Analysis
- Basic understanding of how companies make profit
- Willingness to learn some accounting basics

## Core Content

### What is Fundamental Analysis?

**Fundamental Analysis** is the practice of analyzing a company's financial statements, business model, competitive position, and economic factors to determine its true value.

**The Core Question:** Is this stock's current price a bargain, fairly valued, or overpriced?

**Key Concept:** The stock price today is just a guess about what the company is worth. Fundamental analysis is the detective work to determine if that guess is correct.

**Real-World Analogy:**

Imagine you want to buy a house:
- **Technical Analysis** = Looking at recent sale prices in the neighborhood and price trends
- **Fundamental Analysis** = Inspecting the foundation, roof, plumbing, electrical, square footage, location quality

A house might have sold for $300k last month, but if the foundation is cracked (fundamental issue), the price should be lower. That's fundamental analysis.

### Two Types of Stock Traders

#### 1. Technical Traders
**Focus:** Price and chart patterns
**Question:** Where is price going next?
**Hold Time:** Hours to weeks
**Research:** Charts, volume, indicators
**Risk:** Trend reversal without warning

**Real Example:** A day trader buys Apple at $150 because it bounced from a moving average, regardless of whether Apple's profits are growing or shrinking.

#### 2. Fundamental Investors
**Focus:** Business value and economics
**Question:** Is this company worth more or less than the stock price?
**Hold Time:** Months to years
**Research:** Financial statements, industry trends, management
**Advantage:** Less affected by short-term price swings

**Real Example:** A fundamental investor buys Apple at $150 because the company earned $6/share (P/E of 25), dividends are growing, and the company has $200B in cash.

### The Three Pillars of Fundamental Analysis

#### Pillar 1: Financial Statements (Company's Health)

Every public company must publish three financial statements quarterly and annually:

1. **Income Statement** (Profit & Loss)
   - Shows revenue, expenses, and profit
   - Answer: Is the company making money?
   - Key metric: Net Income (bottom line profit)

2. **Balance Sheet** (Assets & Liabilities)
   - Shows what the company owns and owes
   - Answer: Does the company have financial strength?
   - Key metric: Total Assets minus Total Liabilities

3. **Cash Flow Statement** (Cash Movement)
   - Shows where cash came from and where it went
   - Answer: Is the company generating cash?
   - Key metric: Operating Cash Flow

**Real Example: Apple's Basic Financials**

```
Year: 2023 (Fiscal)

Revenue: $383 billion (money in)
Expenses: $312 billion (money out)
Net Income: $99 billion (profit)

Total Assets: $352 billion
Total Liabilities: $123 billion
Shareholder Equity: $229 billion

Operating Cash Flow: $110 billion
```

**What This Tells Us:**
- Apple made $99B in profit (excellent)
- Assets exceed liabilities by $229B (strong balance sheet)
- Generated $110B in actual cash (not just paper profit)

#### Pillar 2: Valuation Metrics (Price vs. Value)

Valuation metrics help you answer: "Is this stock expensive or cheap?"

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **P/E Ratio** | Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share | How many dollars you pay for $1 of profit |
| **P/B Ratio** | Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share | How many dollars you pay for $1 of assets |
| **Dividend Yield** | Annual Dividend ÷ Stock Price | How much annual income you get |
| **Price-to-Sales** | Market Cap ÷ Total Revenue | How many dollars you pay per $1 of sales |

**Real Example: Apple vs. Tesla**

```
Apple:
- Stock price: $180
- Earnings per share: $6
- P/E Ratio: 180 ÷ 6 = 30
- Interpretation: Pay $30 for every $1 of profit

Tesla:
- Stock price: $250
- Earnings per share: $2
- P/E Ratio: 250 ÷ 2 = 125
- Interpretation: Pay $125 for every $1 of profit

Conclusion: Apple looks cheaper than Tesla
Why: Tesla is speculative growth, Apple is mature/stable
```

#### Pillar 3: Business Quality (Competitive Advantage)

Beyond numbers, fundamental analysts ask: Does this company have a "moat" (competitive advantage)?

**Examples of Moats:**

**Brand Moat** (Strong brand harder to replace)
- Apple: Best tech brand in world
- Nike: Premium athletic brand
- Coca-Cola: Iconic beverage brand

**Network Effect** (More users = more valuable)
- Facebook: Only valuable because everyone is there
- MasterCard: More merchants = more customers attracted
- Netflix: More subscribers = better recommendations

**Switching Cost** (Hard to leave once you buy)
- Microsoft Office: Switching away is expensive
- QuickBooks: Accounting software deeply integrated
- Adobe Creative Suite: Industry standard

**Cost Advantage** (Produce cheaper than competitors)
- Walmart: Massive scale = lowest costs
- Amazon: Logistics network, data efficiency
- Tesla: Manufacturing automation

**Real Example: Netflix Moat Analysis**

```
Why is Netflix defensible despite competition?

Moat 1: Scale/Network Effect
- 250M subscribers
- Massive content budget ($17B/year)
- New competitor can't afford similar content
- So you must subscribe to Netflix for best shows

Moat 2: Data/Technology
- AI recommendations improve with more users
- 250M users = massive data advantage
- Technology hard to replicate

Moat 3: Content
- Original shows (Stranger Things, etc.)
- Can't watch these anywhere else
- Creates switching cost

Fundamental investor conclusion:
Netflix is more defensible than a company with no moat
Therefore, Netflix can sustain higher profit margins and P/E ratio
```

### Why Fundamental Analysis Matters

#### Reason 1: Understanding True Value

A stock's price today is driven by:
- Supply and demand (what buyers/sellers agree on)
- Emotion (fear, greed, hype)
- Technical factors (trends, patterns)
- **Fundamental value** (what the company is actually worth)

Good investors use fundamental analysis to find gaps between price and value.

**Real Example: Tesla Valuation Debate**

```
Some argue Tesla is overvalued:
- P/E Ratio 60+ (expensive vs. other car makers)
- Profits still small vs. revenue
- Strong competition coming

Others argue Tesla is fairly valued:
- Leading in electric vehicles
- Expanding margins (profit improving)
- Growth potential in energy storage

Both sides use fundamental analysis to support their view
Fundamental investors can debate valuations with data
```

#### Reason 2: Identifying Growing Companies

Fundamental analysis reveals which companies are growing and which are struggling.

**Growing Company Signals:**
- Revenue increasing 15%+ year over year
- Profit margins expanding (making more profit per sale)
- Return on equity improving (using assets more efficiently)
- Free cash flow positive and growing

**Declining Company Signals:**
- Revenue flat or declining
- Profit margins shrinking
- Increasing debt
- Negative cash flow

**Real Example: Growth vs. Decline**

```
Software Company A:
- Year 1 Revenue: $100M, Profit: $10M
- Year 2 Revenue: $150M, Profit: $20M
- Year 3 Revenue: $220M, Profit: $40M
Signal: GROWTH (revenue +50%, profit +100%)

Manufacturing Company B:
- Year 1 Revenue: $1000M, Profit: $100M
- Year 2 Revenue: $950M, Profit: $80M
- Year 3 Revenue: $900M, Profit: $60M
Signal: DECLINE (revenue -10%, profit -40%)

Investors should pay higher multiple for Company A
```

#### Reason 3: Avoiding Value Traps

Not all cheap stocks are good bargains. Some are "value traps" - stocks that are cheap for a good reason.

**Value Trap Examples:**

```
Stock trading at P/E of 8 (very cheap vs. market P/E 20)

Reason 1: Company is in decline
- Profits falling
- Lost market share
- Technology obsolete
Verdict: Cheap for a reason - VALUE TRAP

Reason 2: Company is undervalued
- Solid profits, stable business
- Market pessimistic temporarily
- Management buying shares
Verdict: Cheap for temporary reason - OPPORTUNITY

Fundamental analysis tells you which is which
```

### The Fundamental Analysis Workflow

**Step 1: Understand the Business**
- What does the company do?
- How does it make money?
- What industry is it in?

**Step 2: Read Financial Statements**
- Is revenue growing?
- Are profits growing?
- Is cash flow positive?

**Step 3: Calculate Valuation**
- P/E ratio vs. historical average
- P/E ratio vs. industry average
- Other valuation metrics

**Step 4: Analyze Competition**
- Who are main competitors?
- What's the competitive advantage?
- Is it defensible?

**Step 5: Project the Future**
- Will profits grow 5, 10, 20%?
- Where will the stock be worth in 5 years?
- Margin of safety?

**Step 6: Make Investment Decision**
- Is the risk worth the reward?
- Does the margin of safety exist?
- What could go wrong?

### Fundamental vs. Technical: The Complete Trader

The most successful traders combine both:

```
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
When to trade (timing)
Where to enter (price level)
Where to stop loss (risk management)
When to exit (reversal signals)

FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:
What to trade (which stocks)
Why to trade it (value thesis)
How long to hold (investment thesis)
How much to risk (conviction level)
```

**Real Example: Complete Trading Decision**

```
Step 1: Fundamental Analysis (What to trade)
- Research biotech companies
- Find Company X with promising drug trial
- P/E ratio low (50 vs. biotech average 200)
- Thesis: Stock undervalued if trial succeeds

Step 2: Technical Analysis (When to trade)
- Chart shows hammer candlestick on 20-day EMA
- RSI bouncing from 35 (oversold)
- MACD just turned positive
- Signal: Good technical entry point

Step 3: Combined Decision
- Fundamental thesis = BUY (stock is cheap)
- Technical setup = BUY (good entry point)
- Conviction: HIGH
- Action: BUY with full position size

Result:
- If you bought on technical signal alone, you might exit too early
- If you analyzed fundamental thesis, you know why you own it
- Combined approach = best results
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Buying Without Understanding the Business

**Problem:** You buy a stock because the chart looks good, but you don't know what the company does.

**Solution:** Spend 30 minutes learning about the business first. Read the "business summary" on their investor relations site.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Financial Statements

**Problem:** P/E ratio looks cheap, so you buy. Later you learn the company is losing money.

**Solution:** Always check if the company is profitable before buying based on valuation metrics.

### Mistake #3: Mistaking Cheap for Undervalued

**Problem:** Stock has low P/E, so it must be cheap. But you don't check if that low P/E is because profits are collapsing.

**Solution:** Compare current P/E to historical and industry average. Look at profit trends.

### Mistake #4: Assuming Growth Will Always Continue

**Problem:** Bought Microsoft at $300 expecting 30% annual growth forever.

**Solution:** Research shows most companies eventually mature and slow down. What growth rate is sustainable?

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Management Quality

**Problem:** Company has great fundamentals, but management is inexperienced or dishonest.

**Solution:** Research CEO background, board experience, insider trading activity.

## Real-World Application

### Fundamental Analysis in Practice

**Scenario: Deciding Between Two Tech Stocks**

```
Stock A: Microsoft
- Revenue: $200B (growing 10%/year)
- Net Income: $70B (35% profit margin)
- P/E: 35
- Dividend Yield: 0.9%
- Moat: Office software, cloud dominance
- Debt: Low
- Cash: $100B

Stock B: Upstart AI Company
- Revenue: $0.5B (growing 50%/year)
- Net Income: -$50M (losing money)
- P/E: N/A (no earnings)
- Dividend Yield: 0%
- Moat: Technology (but unclear if defensible)
- Debt: Increasing
- Cash: $200M

Which is better?

Answer: Depends on your time horizon and risk tolerance
- Microsoft: Lower growth, higher quality, less risk
- Upstart: Higher growth potential, higher risk, unproven

Both require fundamental analysis to understand the tradeoff

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Business Understanding

Pick a company you use every day (Apple, Netflix, Starbucks, etc.):

1. How does the company make money?
2. Who are its main competitors?
3. What is its competitive advantage?
4. Is that advantage defensible long-term?

**Example Answer: Apple**
1. Sells hardware (iPhones, Macs, etc.) and services (App Store, Apple Music, iCloud)
2. Competitors: Samsung, Google, Microsoft, others
3. Advantages: Brand strength, ecosystem lock-in, vertical integration
4. Defensible: Yes - switching away from iPhone/Mac is expensive

### Exercise 2: Financial Statement Review

Go to investor.apple.com or sec.gov and find Apple's most recent income statement:

1. What was Apple's total revenue?
2. What was Apple's net income (profit)?
3. Calculate profit margin: Net Income ÷ Revenue
4. Is the profit margin good? (Most companies 5-20%, Apple probably higher)

### Exercise 3: Valuation Calculation

Using Apple as example:

1. Find current Apple stock price
2. Find Apple's earnings per share (EPS) for the most recent quarter (annualize it)
3. Calculate P/E Ratio: Stock Price ÷ EPS
4. Research S&P 500 average P/E (around 20-25 typically)
5. Is Apple's P/E higher or lower than market average? What does this mean?
