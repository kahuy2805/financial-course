## Core Content

### What are Financial Ratios?

**Financial Ratios** are calculations that compare different financial metrics to reveal insights about valuation, profitability, and financial health.

**Key Principle:** A ratio by itself is meaningless. Compare it to:
- Historical average (is it higher or lower than usual?)
- Industry average (how does it compare to competitors?)
- Market average (is it expensive or cheap vs. market?)

### Ratio 1: P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)

**What It Shows:** How many dollars investors pay for $1 of annual profit.

**Formula:**
```
P/E = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

Example:
Stock Price: $100
EPS: $5
P/E = 100 ÷ 5 = 20

Interpretation: Paying $20 for every $1 of profit
```

**Real Examples:**

```
Apple: Stock $180, EPS $6, P/E = 30
- Investors pay $30 for every $1 of profit
- Vs. S&P 500 average P/E of 20
- Apple is 50% more expensive than average
- Why? Because Apple is high-quality company with strong competitive advantage

General Motors: Stock $40, EPS $8, P/E = 5
- Investors pay $5 for every $1 of profit
- Vs. S&P 500 average P/E of 20
- GM is 75% cheaper than average
- Why? Because GM is mature, slow-growth, cyclical business
```

**How to Interpret P/E:**

| P/E Level | Interpretation | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| 0-10 | Very cheap (or company losing money) | Value trap risk |
| 10-15 | Cheap | Low downside risk |
| 15-25 | Fair value | Moderate |
| 25-40 | Expensive | Higher downside risk |
| 40+ | Very expensive | High downside risk |

**P/E Considerations:**

**Trailing P/E**: Uses past 12 months of earnings
- More accurate (real earnings)
- Less forward-looking

**Forward P/E**: Uses estimated next 12 months of earnings
- Based on analyst forecasts
- More growth-oriented
- Can be wrong if estimates miss

**Real Example: Growth Stock Premium**

```
Company A (Mature):
- Current Earnings: $10
- Expected Future Earnings: $10.50 (5% growth)
- P/E: 20 (investors not paying much premium for slow growth)

Company B (Growth):
- Current Earnings: $1
- Expected Future Earnings: $2 (100% growth)
- P/E: 50 (investors pay premium for fast growth)

But Company B is riskier (growth might not materialize)
Company A is safer (stable but slow)
Both valuations can be appropriate depending on execution risk
```

### Ratio 2: P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)

**What It Shows:** How many dollars investors pay for $1 of book value (assets minus liabilities per share).

**Formula:**
```
P/B = Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share

Example:
Stock Price: $100
Book Value Per Share: $50
P/B = 100 ÷ 50 = 2.0

Interpretation: Paying 2x the book value
```

**How to Interpret P/B:**

| P/B Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| P/B < 1.0 | Stock trading below asset value (possible bargain or trouble sign) |
| P/B = 1.0-2.0 | Fair value |
| P/B = 2.0-5.0 | Expensive (especially for low-growth companies) |
| P/B > 5.0 | Very expensive (better for high-growth or high-return companies) |

**Real Example: Asset-Heavy vs. Asset-Light**

```
Bank:
- Stock Price: $100
- Book Value: $95 (lots of assets like loans, buildings)
- P/B: 1.05
- Fair for banking because value is in assets

Tech Software Company:
- Stock Price: $100
- Book Value: $10 (fewer physical assets, mostly people/IP)
- P/B: 10
- Fair for tech because value is in intellectual property, not assets

Same P/B ratio looks expensive for banks, cheap for tech companies
Context matters!
```

### Ratio 3: ROE (Return on Equity)

**What It Shows:** How much profit the company generates from shareholder equity (money invested).

**Formula:**
```
ROE = Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity

Example:
Net Income: $50M
Shareholders' Equity: $500M
ROE = 50 ÷ 500 = 10% (or 0.10)

Interpretation: Company generates 10% return on shareholder capital
```

**How to Interpret ROE:**

| ROE Level | Quality |
|---|---|
| ROE < 10% | Poor (money would grow faster in savings account) |
| ROE 10-15% | Average |
| ROE 15-20% | Good |
| ROE 20%+ | Excellent (great business model) |

**Real Example: ROE Comparison**

```
Company A:
- Net Income: $100M
- Shareholders' Equity: $1000M
- ROE = 10%
- Interpretation: Average business, not great returns

Company B:
- Net Income: $100M
- Shareholders' Equity: $500M
- ROE = 20%
- Interpretation: Excellent business, generating strong returns

Company B is better even though both have same profit
Because it's doing it with less shareholder capital (more efficient)
```

**Historical ROE Leaders:**

```
Apple: ROE ~80% (exceptional - uses debt, strong profits)
Microsoft: ROE ~30% (excellent)
Amazon: ROE ~15% (good but reinvesting for growth)
Bank of America: ROE ~10% (average for banks)
```

### Ratio 4: Debt-to-Equity

**What It Shows:** How much debt the company is using compared to equity (financial leverage).

**Formula:**
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Shareholders' Equity

Example:
Total Debt: $200M
Shareholders' Equity: $500M
D/E = 200 ÷ 500 = 0.4

Interpretation: For every $1 of equity, company has $0.40 of debt
```

**How to Interpret D/E:**

| D/E Ratio | Risk Level | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| D/E < 0.5 | Very safe | Conservative capital structure |
| D/E 0.5-1.0 | Safe | Moderate leverage |
| D/E 1.0-2.0 | Moderate Risk | Higher risk in downturns |
| D/E > 2.0 | High Risk | Vulnerable to economic stress |

**Real Example: Debt Varies by Industry**

```
Tech Company:
- Debt: $1B
- Equity: $100B
- D/E: 0.01 (virtually no debt, very safe)

Bank:
- Debt: $800B
- Equity: $100B
- D/E: 8.0 (very high, but normal for banks)

Utility:
- Debt: $40B
- Equity: $60B
- D/E: 0.67 (moderate, typical for utilities)

Same D/E ratio means different things in different industries
Tech with high D/E = DANGEROUS
Banks with high D/E = NORMAL
```

**Why D/E Matters:**

```
During Economic Boom:
- Low D/E: Stable, less profit
- High D/E: Higher profits (using leverage), riskier

During Recession:
- Low D/E: Can weather the storm
- High D/E: Debt payments become burden, risk of bankruptcy
```

### Combining the Four Ratios

**Complete Valuation and Quality Picture:**

```
VALUATION (Is the stock cheap or expensive?)
→ P/E Ratio (price relative to profit)
→ P/B Ratio (price relative to assets)

QUALITY (Is this a good business?)
→ ROE (how much profit on shareholder capital)

FINANCIAL STRENGTH (Can they survive downturns?)
→ Debt-to-Equity (leverage risk)
```

**Real Example: Complete Analysis**

```
Stock A:
- P/E: 15 (cheap relative to market)
- P/B: 1.2 (fair value)
- ROE: 10% (average quality)
- D/E: 0.3 (very safe)
Interpretation: Cheap stock, average quality, safe
Good for: Conservative investors wanting value

Stock B:
- P/E: 35 (expensive relative to market)
- P/B: 4.0 (expensive)
- ROE: 25% (excellent quality)
- D/E: 0.5 (moderate leverage)
Interpretation: Expensive stock, excellent quality, safe
Good for: Growth investors willing to pay premium for quality

Stock C:
- P/E: 8 (very cheap)
- P/B: 0.5 (trading below book value)
- ROE: 3% (terrible quality)
- D/E: 2.5 (high debt, dangerous)
Interpretation: Cheap for a reason, poor business, risky
Danger: Value trap, potential bankruptcy
```

### Industry Variations

**Ratios vary significantly by industry:**

```
Banks (Citigroup):
- High D/E (8.0+) = NORMAL
- Moderate P/E (8-12) = TYPICAL
- Lower ROE (8-12%) = TYPICAL

Tech (Apple):
- Low D/E (0.5) = NORMAL
- Higher P/E (25-35) = TYPICAL
- Very High ROE (50%+) = TYPICAL

Utilities (Duke Energy):
- Moderate D/E (0.8) = NORMAL
- Lower P/E (12-15) = TYPICAL
- Moderate ROE (10-12%) = TYPICAL

Never compare ratios across industries directly
Always compare within industry
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Using P/E Alone

**Problem:** Stock has low P/E so you buy. Later you learn company is in decline.

**Solution:** Combine P/E with ROE and growth rate. Low P/E only good if company is profitable and growing.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring the Industry Context

**Problem:** Tech stock has D/E of 1.5 which looks risky. But that's normal for tech.

**Solution:** Always compare ratios to industry averages, not across industries.

### Mistake #3: Using Stale Data

**Problem:** You use P/E from quarterly earnings, stock has rallied 20% since then.

**Solution:** Update your data before making decisions. Markets move fast.

### Mistake #4: Confusing High P/E with Expensive

**Problem:** Stock has P/E of 40, so it's overpriced. But if it's growing 50%/year, maybe justified.

**Solution:** Consider growth rate. PEG ratio = P/E ÷ growth rate. Compare to 1.0 as benchmark.

### Mistake #5: Not Checking if Earnings Are Real

**Problem:** Low P/E ratio looks great. But company has negative cash flow.

**Solution:** Always verify earnings with cash flow statement. Earnings can be accounting fiction.

## Real-World Application

### Using Ratios in Practice

**Scenario: Picking Between Two Dividend Stocks**

```
Stock A (Old Utility):
- P/E: 12
- P/B: 1.0
- ROE: 8%
- D/E: 0.7
- Dividend: 4%
Appeal: Very cheap, stable

Stock B (Growing Tech):
- P/E: 30
- P/B: 3.5
- ROE: 22%
- D/E: 0.3
- Dividend: 1%
Appeal: Quality, growing

Decision:
- If you want income: Choose A (4% dividend)
- If you want growth: Choose B (higher ROE, lower D/E safer)
- Risk tolerance: A safer (lower D/E), B riskier (growth dependent)
Both decisions defensible, depends on your needs
```

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Calculate Ratios

Given this data for Company XYZ:
- Stock Price: $50
- EPS: $2.50
- Book Value Per Share: $25
- Net Income: $500M
- Shareholders' Equity: $5,000M
- Total Debt: $2,500M

Calculate:
1. P/E Ratio: ___________
2. P/B Ratio: ___________
3. ROE: ___________
4. Debt-to-Equity: ___________

**Answer Key:**
1. P/E = 50 ÷ 2.50 = 20
2. P/B = 50 ÷ 25 = 2.0
3. ROE = 500 ÷ 5000 = 10%
4. D/E = 2500 ÷ 5000 = 0.5

### Exercise 2: Interpret Ratios

For your calculated ratios above, write brief interpretation:

1. Is the stock expensive or cheap? (Compare P/E of 20 to market average of 18)
2. Is the book value reasonable? (Is P/B of 2.0 fair?)
3. Is the ROE good? (10% is average or excellent?)
4. Is the debt reasonable? (Is D/E of 0.5 safe?)

### Exercise 3: Compare Companies

Pick two companies in same industry (Apple vs. Microsoft, or Nike vs. Adidas):

1. Get their most recent P/E, P/B, ROE, and D/E
2. Compare which is more expensive
3. Compare which has better quality (ROE)
4. Compare which is safer (D/E)
5. Which would you buy and why?
