### Why Earnings Matter

**Earnings Report** is when a company announces its quarterly financial results to the public.

**Why It's Crucial:**

Stock prices are based on two things:
1. **Current profit** (what the company makes now)
2. **Expected future profit** (what investors think it will make)

Earnings reports update both of these, causing massive price swings.

**Real Example: Earnings Surprises**

```
Situation: Apple announces earnings

Expected Earnings Per Share: $1.50
Actual Earnings Per Share: $1.60
Beat by: 6.7%

Result: Stock rallies 8% same day
Why? Profit is better than expected, future looks better

Opposite scenario:
Expected EPS: $1.50
Actual EPS: $1.40
Miss by: 6.7%

Result: Stock drops 12% same day
Why? Profit is worse than expected, future looks worse
```

### The Earnings Report Components

#### 1. EPS (Earnings Per Share)

**What It Is:** Net profit divided by number of shares outstanding.

```
Net Income: $50B
Shares Outstanding: 16B
EPS = $50B ÷ 16B = $3.125
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Company can be profitable but share count can inflate/deflate
- Buybacks reduce shares (same profit, higher EPS)
- Share dilution increases shares (same profit, lower EPS)

**Real Example: Apple vs. Microsoft Share Counts**

```
Apple:
- Net Income: $99B
- Shares: 15B
- EPS: $6.60

Microsoft:
- Net Income: $72B
- Shares: 8.4B
- EPS: $8.57

Same profit, different EPS because of different share counts
Apple doing more buybacks, reducing share count
```

#### 2. Revenue (Top Line)

**What It Is:** Total sales before any expenses.

**Key Questions:**
- Is revenue growing? (Should be 5-15% year-over-year)
- Is growth accelerating or slowing?
- Is growth driven by price increases or volume increases?

**Real Example: Good vs. Bad Revenue**

```
Company A:
- Year 1 Revenue: $100M
- Year 2 Revenue: $115M (+15% growth)
- Year 2 Gross Margin: 45% (same as Year 1)
Signal: HEALTHY GROWTH

Company B:
- Year 1 Revenue: $100M
- Year 2 Revenue: $110M (+10% growth)
- Year 2 Gross Margin: 40% (down from 45%)
Signal: WEAK GROWTH and margin compression

Company A better even though lower revenue growth
```

#### 3. Guidance (Forward Guidance)

**What It Is:** Company's projection for next quarter or next year's earnings.

**Why It's Critical:**
- Stock responds to EXPECTATIONS
- If company guides higher than consensus, stock rallies
- If company guides lower than consensus, stock crashes

**Real Example: Guidance Miss**

```
Situation: Microsoft earnings

Reported Numbers: BEAT
- Q3 EPS: $2.75 vs expected $2.60
- Revenue: $52B vs expected $51B
- Both beat, stock should go up!

But company guidance for Q4:
- Expected: $3.00 EPS
- Guidance: $2.90 EPS (3.3% miss!)

Result: Stock drops 5% despite beating current quarter
Why? Market cares more about FUTURE than past
Future guidance missed, so future profits might be lower
```

#### 4. Operating Margin

**What It Is:** Operating profit divided by revenue (profit before interest and taxes).

```
Operating Profit: $50M
Revenue: $200M
Operating Margin: 25%
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Shows if company is getting more efficient
- Expanding margin = improving profitability
- Contracting margin = struggles with costs

#### 5. Free Cash Flow

**What It Is:** Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.

**Why It Matters:**
- More important than profit (real cash)
- Shows if profit is sustainable
- Available for dividends, buybacks, debt paydown

### The Four Types of Earnings Beats/Misses

#### Beat on EPS, Beat on Revenue

```
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.60 ✓
Expected Revenue: $100M, Actual: $110M ✓

Result: VERY BULLISH
Stock usually rallies 5-15%
```

#### Beat on EPS, Miss on Revenue

```
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.60 ✓
Expected Revenue: $110M, Actual: $105M ✗

Result: MIXED (Usually negative)
Company cut costs to hit EPS, but sales disappointed
Stock usually drops 3-8%
```

#### Miss on EPS, Beat on Revenue

```
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.45 ✗
Expected Revenue: $100M, Actual: $115M ✓

Result: MIXED (Usually positive if growth is strong)
Revenue is strong, but margins compressed
Stock reaction depends on margin outlook
```

#### Miss on EPS, Miss on Revenue

```
Expected EPS: $1.50, Actual: $1.30 ✗
Expected Revenue: $110M, Actual: $100M ✗

Result: VERY BEARISH
Stock usually drops 10-20%
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Year-over-Year Growth (YoY)**

Compare current quarter to same quarter last year:

```
Q1 2024 Revenue: $50B
Q1 2023 Revenue: $45B
YoY Growth: (50-45)/45 = 11.1%

This is much better indicator than sequential (quarter to quarter)
Because of seasonality effects
```

**Forward P/E vs. Trailing P/E**

```
Trailing P/E: Uses actual past earnings
- Stock Price $100, Past 12 months EPS $5
- Trailing P/E: 20

Forward P/E: Uses estimated future earnings
- Stock Price $100, Next 12 months estimated EPS $5.50
- Forward P/E: 18.2

Forward P/E lower means market expecting earnings growth
This is positive sign if guidance supports it
```

**Guidance Quality**

```
Conservative Guidance:
- Company estimates low growth
- Usually beats, stock rallies
- Happens when management is confident

Aggressive Guidance:
- Company estimates high growth
- Usually meets or barely beats
- Risky if they miss, stock crashes
```

### Reading an Earnings Report

**Structure of Earnings Release:**

1. **Top line results** (EPS and Revenue)
2. **Key metrics** (margins, growth, etc.)
3. **Segment breakdown** (results by business line)
4. **Forward guidance** (next quarter/year expectations)
5. **Management discussion**

**Red Flags to Watch:**

```
⚠️ "One-time charges" or "restructuring costs"
→ One-time charges can distort results

⚠️ "In line with guidance" but actual beat is small
→ Conservative guidance, expectations low

⚠️ Revenue beat but margin miss
→ Growing top-line but profit shrinking (bad)

⚠️ Guidance lowered from previous guidance
→ Company just lowered expectations, more pain ahead

⚠️ High executive turnover mentioned
→ Leadership instability, uncertainty

⚠️ "Challenging macro environment"
→ Blaming external factors instead of taking responsibility
```

**Green Flags to Watch:**

```
✓ Revenue AND earnings both beat
→ Strong execution, execution risk low

✓ Margin expansion
→ Getting more efficient, pricing power

✓ Guidance raised
→ Management confidence increasing

✓ Free cash flow acceleration
→ Profitability improving in real cash terms

✓ Share buybacks announced
→ Management thinks stock is undervalued
```

### The Earnings Calendar

**Timing of Earnings:**

- **Q1 Earnings:** April-May
- **Q2 Earnings:** July-August
- **Q3 Earnings:** October-November
- **Q4 Earnings:** January-February

**Key Dates Around Earnings:**

```
Day 0: Earnings released (usually after market close)
Day 0-2: Stock reacts massively (10%+ moves common)
Day 5-7: Analyst updates and revisions
Week 2-3: Most of the shock is absorbed
Month 1-2: Stock settles into new valuation

Best trading opportunities:
- Day 0-1: Biggest reaction if you trade immediately
- Day 5-7: After initial shock, as revisions come in
- Avoid: Day 2-3, still volatile and emotional
```

### The Earnings Surprise Effect

**Why Stocks React Before Earnings:**

```
Option A: Company beats on EPS but guides lower
- Stock was down 5% already (market sensed weak guidance)
- Earnings beat doesn't matter because future is weak

Option B: Company beats on EPS, guidance is strong
- Stock rallies even more (both now and future are good)

Lesson: Stock price anticipates earnings surprises
Market is forward-looking
```

**Real Example: Netflix Earnings Reactions**

```
Scenario 1: Strong Earnings, Raised Guidance
- Revenue Beat: Yes (+20% YoY)
- Subscriber Growth: Beat expectations by 100k
- Guidance: Raised full-year outlook
- Result: Stock rallies 15% next day

Scenario 2: Weak Earnings, Maintained Guidance
- Revenue Miss: -2% YoY
- Subscriber Growth: Miss expectations by 200k
- Guidance: Maintained (same as before)
- Result: Stock drops 10% next day

Market cares about trajectory
Beat with weak guidance worse than miss with strong guidance
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Trading the Day Before Earnings

**Problem:** Hoping for a beat, you buy day before. Stock crashes on miss.

**Solution:** Either trade the morning after (confirmed direction) or avoid earnings week entirely.

### Mistake #2: Focusing Only on EPS Beat

**Problem:** EPS beat, but company cut guidance. You think it's bullish.

**Solution:** Always check guidance. Guidance is more important than current beat.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the Margin Story

**Problem:** Revenue beats, stock rallies. You don't notice margins compressed.

**Solution:** Compare margins to past quarters. Expanding margins better than margin compression.

### Mistake #4: Missing Cash Flow Story

**Problem:** Profit looks good, but free cash flow is negative.

**Solution:** Always check free cash flow. Profit can be fiction, cash is real.

### Mistake #5: Not Checking Year-over-Year Comparison

**Problem:** Revenue up 20% quarter-to-quarter, you think it's great. But it's just seasonal.

**Solution:** Always compare to same quarter last year (YoY), not last quarter.

## Real-World Application

### Pre-Earnings Research Checklist

Before earnings announcement:

- [ ] What are consensus estimates? (Revenue and EPS)
- [ ] What's the historical beat/miss rate? (Does company usually beat or miss?)
- [ ] What were margins last quarter? (Expecting expansion or compression?)
- [ ] What was free cash flow last quarter?
- [ ] What guidance was given last quarter?
- [ ] Are there any one-time items expected?
- [ ] Which key metric matters most? (Subscribers for Netflix, iPhone sales for Apple?)

### Post-Earnings Reaction Plan

```
IF Beat + Raise Guidance:
→ VERY BULLISH, most likely up 5-15%
→ Next support = 50-day MA or Fib 38.2%

IF Beat + Maintain Guidance:
→ NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY BULLISH, usually up 2-5%
→ Less upside potential

IF Miss + Cut Guidance:
→ VERY BEARISH, most likely down 5-20%
→ Next support = 200-day MA or Fib 61.8%

IF Miss + Maintain Guidance:
→ NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY BEARISH, usually down 2-5%
→ Watch for reversal
```

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise 1: Find and Analyze Real Earnings

Go to investor.apple.com or company website:

1. Find Apple's most recent earnings announcement
2. What was the EPS? Vs. Expected?
3. What was the revenue? Vs. Expected?
4. What was the guidance?
5. What was the stock reaction? (% up or down)

### Exercise 2: Margin Analysis

For the same earnings:

1. What was the gross margin?
2. What was the operating margin?
3. Compare to previous quarter
4. Was margin expanding or contracting?
5. Why does this matter?

### Exercise 3: Earnings Calendar

For the next 5 earnings announcements:

1. Note the date of announcement
2. Note the expected EPS and revenue
3. Track actual results
4. Track stock reaction next day
5. Did it beat or miss?
6. Did stock move as expected?

## Key Takeaways

✓ **EPS** = Earnings per share, most watched metric
✓ **Revenue** = Top line, should grow 5-15% YoY
✓ **Margins** = Operating and gross margin trends matter
✓ **Guidance** = Future expectations, sometimes more important than current beat
