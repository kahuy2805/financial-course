## 📚 Knowledge Check

Before starting, you should be able to answer:

1. What is money? (Medium of exchange)
2. What does "profit" mean? (Earning more than you spent)
3. What does "loss" mean? (Spending more than you earned)

## 📞 Questions Before Starting?

### "I don't have any trading experience. Is that okay?"
Perfect! This course is designed for complete beginners.

### "I'm not good at math. Can I still learn trading?"
Yes. We use basic math only and provide calculators for everything.

### "I don't have money to trade. Should I wait?"
No. Start with paper trading (free). Real money comes much later, if at all.

### "I'm older/younger. Does age matter?"
No. Trading is for any age. Concepts are universal.

### "English isn't my first language. Will I struggle?"
Possibly with some vocabulary, but we define all technical terms. Google Translate can help with anything unclear.

### "I have a full-time job. Can I still learn?"
Absolutely. Many successful traders work full-time. Part-time study works well.

### "I failed at trading before. Should I try again?"
Yes, if you approach it differently this time with structured education and proper risk management.
