### 1. Take Notes
Keep a dedicated notebook or digital document. Summarize each lesson in your own words. This aids retention and understanding.

Each lesson is designed for 15-20 minutes of reading, but take longer if needed. Understanding is more important than speed.

### 3. Practice Before Moving Forward
Complete exercises before advancing. Skipping practice undermines your learning.

### 4. Start a Trading Journal
Begin journaling from day one, even for paper trades. This habit is crucial for long-term success (covered in Lesson 5.4).

### 5. Review Regularly
Schedule weekly reviews of key concepts. Spaced repetition improves retention.

### 6. Ask Questions
Use the Common Problems & Solutions guide in the Mentorship Framework section when stuck.
