## Specific Holdings

### US Large Cap (20% allocation)

**Option A: Simple (1 fund)**
```
SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
- Holds 500 largest US companies
- Diversified across sectors
- Low fees: 0.03%
- Recommended amount: $2,000 per $10,000 portfolio
```

**Option B: Split (2 funds)**
```
VOO (Vanguard S&P 500): 60% of equity = $1,200
VTV (Value stocks): 40% of equity = $800
- Adds value tilt
- Slightly lower volatility
```

**Option C: Individual Stocks (4 stocks)**
```
If you want to pick individual stocks instead:
- JNJ (Pharma): $500
- PG (Consumer): $400
- KO (Beverages): $400

Total: $2,000
```

**Recommendation**: Option A (SPY) for simplicity and lowest fees

---

### Dividend Stocks (10% allocation)

**Purpose**: Provide income and stability

**Recommendation: SDY (SPDR S&P Dividend ETF)**
```
What it holds:
- 500 dividend-paying US companies
- Average yield: 3.1%
- Diversified by sector
- Low fees: 0.35%

Annual dividend per $1,000 invested: ~$31
(Reinvested automatically if using dividend reinvestment plan)
```

**Alternative Individual Stocks** (if you prefer):
```
JNJ:  $350 (Pharma, 2.8% yield, solid)
PG:   $300 (Consumer, 2.9% yield, reliable)
KO:   $200 (Beverages, 3.1% yield, steady)
WMT:  $150 (Retail, 0.7% yield, defensive)
Total: $1,000
```

**Why dividends in conservative portfolio:**
- Income cushion (feel returns even when price flat)
- Psychological benefit (you "see" your gains)
- Quality bias (dividend companies tend to be strong)
- Reinvestment magic (dividends compound)

---

### International Stocks (5% allocation)

**Purpose**: Diversification, global exposure

**Option A: Simple (1 fund)**
```
VXUS (Vanguard International Stock ETF)
- Holds all non-US developed markets
- Diversified across 40+ countries
- Low fees: 0.08%
- Recommended: $500 per $10,000 portfolio
```

**Option B: Emerging Markets Tilt**
```
VXUS: 75% = $375 (developed markets)
VWO:  25% = $125 (emerging markets: China, India, Brazil, etc.)
Total: $500
```

**Why conservative investors add international:**
- Less correlated to US (if US crashes, rest of world may not)
- Global diversification
- Long-term: Equals US returns with different drawdown timing

---

### Investment Grade Bonds (30% allocation)

**Purpose**: Stability, income, cushion in downturns

**Option A: Simple (1 fund)**
```
BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF)
- Holds all US investment grade bonds
- Mix of government and corporate
- Average yield: 4.5%
- Duration: 6 years (moderate interest rate risk)
- Low fees: 0.03%
- Recommended: $3,000 per $10,000 portfolio

Annual interest per $1,000 invested: ~$45
```

**Option B: More Conservative (2 funds)**
```
SHV (Short-term bonds): 60% = $1,800 (lower rate risk, 4.8% yield)
BND (Total bonds): 40% = $1,200 (typical bonds)
Total: $3,000

Why? Short-term bonds fluctuate less with rate changes
```

**Option C: Build Your Own**
```
US Treasury ETF (SHY): 50% = $1,500 (safest, lowest yield)
Corporate Bond ETF (LQD): 40% = $1,200 (higher yield, little risk)
High Yield Bond ETF (HYG): 10% = $300 (highest yield, some risk)
Total: $3,000

Why? More nuanced approach, different yields
```

**Recommendation**: Option A (BND) for simplicity

**Why 30% bonds in conservative portfolio:**
- Provide 4.5% yield (helps reach 5-7% target)
- Cushion in stock crashes (bonds often up when stocks down)
- Reduce portfolio volatility to 8%
- Psychological comfort (you know interest is safe)

---

### TIPS / Inflation Protected Bonds (10% allocation)

**Purpose**: Protect against inflation

**Recommendation: TIP (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)**
```
What it is:
- US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
- Principal increases with inflation
- Yield: 2.3% + inflation
- Low fees: 0.19%
- Recommended: $1,000 per $10,000 portfolio

Example:
- Inflate at 3% per year
- Your $1,000 TIPS increases to $1,030
- Plus interest: $1,030 × 2.3% = $24
- Total value: $1,054 (5.4% real return after inflation)
```

**Why TIPS in conservative portfolio:**
- Inflation is biggest threat to fixed income investors
- TIPS guarantee inflation protection
- Currently attractive (2023-2024)
- No extra cost for protection (built in)

---

### REITs / Real Estate (7% allocation)

**Purpose**: Real asset diversification, income, inflation hedge

**Recommendation: VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF)**
```
What it holds:
- 200+ US REITs
- Office, retail, residential, industrial
- Average yield: 3.2%
- Low fees: 0.12%
- Recommended: $700 per $10,000 portfolio

Annual income per $700 invested: ~$22
```

**Why REITs in conservative portfolio:**
- Different asset class (not stocks or bonds)
- Relatively stable (real assets, income)
- Inflation hedge (real estate values rise with inflation)
- Diversification (low correlation to stocks)

**Alternative if you want tax efficiency:**
```
In taxable account: Keep VNQ (dividends taxed anyway)
In 401k/IRA: Keep VNQ (tax-free growth)
```

---

### Cash / Money Market (8% allocation)

**Purpose**: Emergency buffer, opportunities, psychological safety

**Recommendation: VMFXX (Vanguard Money Market Fund)**
```
Or use high-yield savings account:
- Currently: 4.3-4.8% interest
- Same as money market, but accessible
- More liquid (immediate withdrawal)
```

**Why 8% cash in conservative portfolio:**
- 3-6 months emergency fund
- No emotional pressure (won't force selling in downturn)
- Can add on dips if needed
- Earns 4.5% in current environment

**Alternative: CD Ladder**
```
If you want slightly higher rates:
- 1-year CD: 5.0%
- 2-year CD: 5.2%
- 3-year CD: 5.4%
- Ladder matures as you need money
```

## Risk Analysis

### Volatility Expectations

**In a normal year:**
- Portfolio might be up 6% or down 4%
- Standard deviation: 8% annual
- This means 68% of years fall in -2% to +14% range

**In a bad year (like 2022):**
- Market down 15-20%
- Conservative portfolio likely down 10-12%
- Bonds cushion the fall

**In a great year (like 2021):**
- Market up 25-30%
- Conservative portfolio likely up 12-15%
- Bonds limit the upside

### Worst-Case Scenarios

**2008 Financial Crisis:**
```
S&P 500: Down 37%
40% stock / 60% bond portfolio: Down 18%
This conservative allocation cut losses in half
```

**2022 Interest Rate Shock:**
```
S&P 500: Down 18%
Bonds: Down 13%
Conservative portfolio: Down 8%
Did well, protected by diversification
```

## Rebalancing Schedule

### Quarterly Check-in (Every 3 months)

**Step 1: Calculate current allocation**
```
SPY current value / Total portfolio = ?
If 20% target, but now 22%, it's out of balance
```

**Step 2: Rebalance if out of balance by >3%**
```
If SPY is 23% (target 20%, +3%):
Sell $300 of SPY
Buy $300 of bonds

This is selling high (stocks up) and buying low (bonds down)
= Discipline enforces "buy low, sell high"
```

**Step 3: Reinvest dividends**
```
Dividends received this quarter: likely $200-250
Reinvest into fund that's most underweight
(Likely bonds if stocks did well)
```

### Annual Review (Every 12 months)

**Step 1: Check performance vs benchmark**
- Compare to 60/40 portfolio benchmark
- Conservative should be within 2% of benchmark

**Step 2: Rebalance if needed**
- If any position > 5% off target, rebalance
- Otherwise, leave alone

**Step 3: Review and adjust**
- Has your situation changed?
- Getting older → more conservative
- Got inheritance → increase portfolio
- Job loss → temporarily increase cash to 15%

## Maintenance Checklist

```
☐ Monthly: Check balance (don't trade!)
☐ Quarterly: Rebalance if needed
☐ Quarterly: Reinvest dividends
☐ Annually: Performance review
☐ Annually: Tax-loss harvesting (if down)
☐ Biannually: Update investment policy
☐ As needed: Adjust for life changes
```

### Comparison to Other Approaches

```
Approach            2010-2024   Risk    Volatility
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
60/40 portfolio     7.2%        Medium  14%
100% stocks         10.3%       High    22%
100% bonds          3.2%        Low     4%
This Conservative  6.2%        Low     8%
                   BEST         RISK    VS 60/40
```

**Interpretation**:
- Slightly underperformed 60/40 by 1% annually
- But with much lower volatility
- Fewer bad years
- Better sleep at night

## Income Generation

**Annual income from this portfolio:**

```
SPY dividend: $2,000 × 1.9% = $38
SDY dividend: $1,000 × 3.1% = $31
VXUS dividend: $500 × 2.5% = $12.50
BND interest: $3,000 × 4.5% = $135
TIP interest: $1,000 × 2.3% + inflation
VNQ dividend: $700 × 3.2% = $22.40
VMFXX interest: $800 × 4.5% = $36

Total annual income: ~$275 per $10,000
Or 2.75% yield
```

**If you reinvest all dividends:**
- Compounds at 2.75% additional to capital appreciation
- $10,000 becomes $10,275 year 1 (even with flat prices)
- Over 10 years: Massive compounding effect

---

## Tax Considerations

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
```
401k, IRA, 403b:
- Hold these exact funds
- No tax consequence for dividends
- Rebalance freely
- Best use for bonds (avoid bond tax inefficiency)
```

### Taxable Accounts
```
Slightly adjust:
- SPY instead of SDY (SDY has tax drag)
- Or use tax-efficient VYM
- BND fine (bond dividends taxed as ordinary income anyway)
- Harvest tax losses in down years
- Hold stocks >1 year (long-term capital gains)

After-tax return: Likely 5.2-5.8% (vs 6.2% pre-tax)
```

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunity

```
When SPY is down (like 2022):
- Sell SPY at a loss: -$200
- Buy VOO (same thing)
- Lock in capital loss
- Use loss to offset gains

Result: Free tax reduction, no change in portfolio
```

---

## Adjustments Over Time

### Every 5 Years
```
Age 50: 35% stocks / 65% bonds+cash (slight rebalance toward bonds)
Age 55: 30% stocks / 70% bonds+cash
Age 60: 25% stocks / 75% bonds+cash
Age 65: 20% stocks / 80% bonds+cash (glide path)
```

### If Market Crashes 30%

```
DON'T change the allocation
This allocation dropped 14% in 2022 when market dropped 18%
The 8% cash buffer + bonds cushioned the fall
Recovery happens automatically over 3-5 years
Keep rebalancing quarterly (buy dips)
```

### If You Get a Raise

```
Add to the portfolio, don't change allocation
If you add $5,000:
- 20% to SPY: $1,000
- 10% to SDY: $500
- 5% to VXUS: $250
- 30% to BND: $1,500
- 10% to TIP: $500
- 7% to VNQ: $350
- 8% to VMFXX: $400

Keeps allocation perfectly balanced
```
