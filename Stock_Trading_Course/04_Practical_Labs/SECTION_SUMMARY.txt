CONTACT & SUPPORT
================================================================================

This section was designed to be self-contained and comprehensive.

If you have questions:
  • Review the reflection questions in each section
  • Re-read the lessons learned section
  • Compare your situation to similar case studies
  • Start with a simple portfolio (Project 01)

================================================================================
FINAL NOTE
================================================================================

The Practical Labs section is the most important part of this course because
knowledge without application is just theory. These case studies, simulations,
and portfolio projects bridge the gap between understanding and doing.

Use them not as a one-time read, but as a resource you return to:
  • When making investment decisions
  • When experiencing volatility
  • When questioning your strategy
  • When considering new approaches

The lessons here are timeless. Markets change, but human psychology doesn't.

Good luck with your practical education!
