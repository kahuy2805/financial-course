  "This is temporary, buy the dip"
  Strong support from value investors

  "Is this a correction or crash?"

### Sarah's Emotional Decision Points

**Decision Point 1: February 28 (-12% down)**
- Text from friend: "Market's crashing, should we sell?"
- Sarah's thought: "No, this is temporary. Long-term investing means holding through downturns"
- **Action**: HOLD

**Decision Point 2: March 12 (-25% down)**
- News headlines: "Worst market crash since Great Depression"
- Margin call warning in her account (had small margin position)
- Sarah's thought: "OK, maybe I should reduce some risk"
- **Action**: Sell 20% of stock positions, raise to 30% cash
- **Rationale**: "Just being prudent, keeping dry powder"

**Decision Point 3: March 23 (-34% down, market bottom approaching)**
- Breaking news: "Treasury secretary warns of deep recession"
- Sarah's 401k emails showing loss statements daily
- Sarah's thought: "This could keep going down. My 20-year horizon doesn't matter if we go to zero"
- **Action**: Panic sell remaining 80% of stocks
- **Amount**: Converts $260,000 to cash at market bottom
- **Real quote from similar investors**: "I can't sleep at night, my family needs this money"

**Decision Point 4: March 24-31 (Bounce +7%)**
- Market shows positive signs, Fed cuts rates
- Headlines shift to "Green shoots of recovery"
- Sarah's thought: "I sold at the bottom, now I've missed the bounce"
- **Action**: Waits for "better price," stays in cash

**Decision Point 5: April 17 (Recovery to -15% from peak)**
- Markets clearly recovering, FOMO kicks in
- Sarah buys back 80% of original stock position at much higher price
- Price paid: $168/share for SPY (vs $162/share on March 23)
- **Action**: Full reentry, back to original allocation

### Financial Impact of Sarah's Decisions

```
Original Strategy (Hold Through Crisis):
  Buy & Hold: $350,000 → Lowest $231,000 → End $430,000 (+23%)
  Emotional cost: High volatility but best outcome

Sarah's Actual Strategy (Sold at bottom, bought back late):
  Start: $350,000
  Sold 20% (Mar 12): Raised to $308,000 cash
  Sold remaining (Mar 23): Raised to $260,000 cash
  Bought back (Apr 17): Spent $258,000 (fees, taxes)
  Final Value: $408,000 (+16.6%)

Opportunity Cost: $22,000 in missed gains
Tax Damage: $8,000 in short-term capital gains taxes
Psychological Damage: Destroyed confidence for 2 years
```

## Key Decision Points and Lessons

### Decision Point Analysis

**The Critical Error: Confusing "Time Horizon" with "Stomach Strength"**

Sarah said she had a 20-year horizon, but her actual emotional capacity for drawdown was only 20%. This gap between philosophy and behavior cost her 22,000 in wealth.

**Warning Signs Sarah Missed:**
1. **Valuation Context**: Even down 34%, the market was still fairly valued
2. **Dividend Yield**: SPY yielding 2.1% at March 23 bottom - attractive for long-term
3. **Fed Response**: Unlimited QE announced March 15 - policy support evident
4. **Historical Precedent**: 2008-2009 crash followed by 8-year bull market
5. **Margin Requirement**: Sarah only had minimal margin, no forced selling needed

**The Capitulation Point:**
March 23 marked the S&P 500 low. Market bottom occurred 4 days AFTER Sarah's panic sale, which is the pattern in almost every market crash:
- The worst news occurs near the bottom
- Maximum pessimism happens at maximum opportunity
- Panic selling accelerates just before recovery

### The Opposite Scenario: Disciplined Response

**David Wong's Strategy (Same starting position, opposite discipline)**

David had the same $350,000 portfolio but:
1. **Set stop losses strategically**: Only on individual positions, not index funds
2. **Dollar-cost averaged into decline**: Added $10,000 at -15%, -25%, -32%
3. **Viewed as discount event**: "Stocks on sale, buying instead of selling"
4. **Maintained 30-year horizon discipline**: "Long-term wealth building continues"
5. **Outcome**: Added $30,000 at average price of $165/share
   - Final portfolio value: $480,000
   - Gain of +37% vs Sarah's +16.6%
   - Difference: $72,000 in additional wealth

**David's Journal Entry March 23:**
> "Market is down 34%. This is terrifying but also obvious. Everyone is selling. Headlines are catastrophic. Fed is supporting markets. I have a 30-year horizon. This is literally the moment we're supposed to buy. Adding $10,000 today while scared feels right."

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Market Crashes Are Predictable in Their Unpredictability
- The TIMING is unknowable (could have lasted 6 months)
- The SEVERITY is usually worse than feared
- The RECOVERY is usually faster than expected
- **Action**: Plan for 40% drawdowns, don't react to them

### Lesson 2: Your Real Risk Tolerance ≠ Your Stated Risk Tolerance
- Sarah said she could handle volatility
- Reality: She couldn't psychologically
- **Action**: Stress-test your psychology before the crash hits
  - Could you sleep at night down 30%?
  - Would you buy or sell at market bottoms?
  - Is your asset allocation matching your actual temperament?

### Lesson 3: Time Horizon Only Works If You Don't Need the Money
- Sarah's $350,000 was for retirement (20+ years away)
- Yet she treated it like money needed this year
- **Action**: Separate time horizons by account purpose
  - Near-term (0-3 years): Bonds, stable value
  - Medium-term (3-10 years): Mixed portfolio
  - Long-term (10+): Stocks, growth

### Lesson 4: Panic Selling Happens at Maximum Pain, Not Maximum Risk
- Maximum risk occurred when crash started
- Maximum pain occurred at maximum opportunity
- These are opposite points in the cycle
- **Action**: Your worst emotional moments are your best investment moments

### Lesson 5: Dollar-Cost Averaging Into Declines Works
David added $10,000 at each 10% decline:
- Purchase 1 at -15%: Got 65 shares at $156/share
- Purchase 2 at -25%: Got 60 shares at $165/share
- Purchase 3 at -32%: Got 57 shares at $175/share
- **Total**: 182 extra shares at $163 average
- By year-end: Worth $175/share × 182 = $31,850 gain

### Lesson 6: Market Bottoms Occur When Sentiment Is Most Negative
Measured by VIX (fear index):
- Normal VIX: 12-20
- Elevated VIX: 20-30
- Fear extreme: 40-50
- March 16 VIX reached 82.69 (highest ever except 2008)
- This extreme level marked the turning point

### Lesson 7: The Recovery Is Fastest Right After the Bottom
If you sold at the bottom (Sarah, March 23), you missed:
- March 23 to April 17: +19% (fastest recovery period)
- This is when bounce-back happens fastest
- By the time you feel comfortable buying back, you've missed the move

## Questions for Reflection

### On Your Behavior
1. **Are your investment rules written down before market crashes?**
   - Sarah had no written rules for crises
   - When panic hits, written rules guide decisions
   - Do you have a "crash playbook"?

2. **What would you actually do in a 30% drawdown?**
   - Most people say "hold through it"
   - Would you actually?
   - How would you respond to spouse/family pressure?

3. **Do you have emergency funds separate from investments?**
   - Sarah's nervousness came from not having 2 years of expenses in cash
   - If you need your portfolio for near-term needs, you can't think long-term
   - Is your asset allocation based on time horizon or fear?

### On the Market
4. **What would have given you confidence to hold through March 2020?**
   - Fed support? (Arrived March 15)
   - Historical perspective? (Similar to 2008, 1987)
   - Valuation? (Actually reasonable even down 34%)
   - Which of these would have actually worked?

5. **How would you have identified the March 23 bottom in real-time?**
   - You couldn't, of course
   - But how would you have positioned for uncertainty?
   - Dollar-cost averaging doesn't require timing the bottom

6. **What would prevent you from buying back at April 17 prices?**
   - Fear of deeper crashes? (But the crash had just happened)
   - Sense that you'd already lost? (Sunk cost fallacy)
   - Waiting for more proof? (But proof only appears in hindsight)

### On Your Rules
7. **What's your plan for the next 30% crash?**
   - Specific actions, not just philosophy
   - Specific price levels or percentages
   - Specific trigger points for action

8. **How does your emergency fund size affect your investment strategy?**
   - Rule of thumb: 6-12 months of expenses in safe assets
   - This allows you to stay invested in crashes
   - What's your current level?
